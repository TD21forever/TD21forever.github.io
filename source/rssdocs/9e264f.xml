总结: 一位CEO承认解雇了他的客服团队并用AI聊天机器人取而代之，这表明了一种不负责任的趋势，即用机器人取代人类工人。自动化可能会在菲律宾消除超过100万个呼叫中心工作岗位。在印度，人工智能已经重塑了劳动力并消除了一些职位。公司不是适应工作，而是直接用人工智能取代人类，导致工人毫无准备地失去工作，而没有替代计划。 </div>

总结: 过去的社交媒体主要是朋友们分享日常生活，但在2010年左右，越来越多的朋友开始分享新闻文章。与此同时，我们的动态中也开始出现越来越多的广告。在过去的十年里，社交媒体让我感觉我几乎不再了解这些人，而不是让我感觉更亲近。最近，我看到Facebook正在引入AI机器人，这些机器人具有名人的个性。其他社交媒体平台会不会也效仿？目标是让人们与名人的AI复制品互动比与自己的朋友更多吗？再加上我在每个“朋友”的帖子之间看到3-4个广告，我对人与人之间互动的未来并不抱有太多希望。你认为在未来几年里，AI会如何改变我们与社交媒体的互动方式？AI是否有办法让我们与其他人感觉更加联系紧密？ </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I'm old enough to remember a time when social media was mostly about friends sharing their daily lives. This seemed to change around 2010, when more and more of my friends' posts were simply them sharing news articles. It was around this time that we'd start seeing more and more ads in our feeds. </p> <p>For a while (2001-2010) social media seemed to work to actually make me feel closer to the people in my life, especially the ones that I didn't get to see very often. But for the past decade or so, it has made me feel, for the most part, like I don't even know these people anymore. </p> <p>I saw recently that Facebook is introducing AI bots that take on the personalities of celebrities. Will other social media platforms do the same? Is the goal to have humans interacting more with AI replicas of famous people than their own friends? Combine this with the fact that I see 3-4 ads between every single post from a &quot;friend&quot; and I don't exactly feel hopeful for the future of human-human interaction.</p> <p>How do you think AI will change how we engage with social media over the next few years? Is there a way for AI to somehow make us feel <em>more</em> connected with other humans?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/themistergraves"> /u/themistergraves </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1701ztj/how_do_you_think_ai_llms_specifically_will_change/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1701ztj/how_do_you_think_ai_llms_specifically_will_change/">[comments]</a></span>

<br>
总结: 这篇文章介绍了一种名为PIT的新方法，它使LLMs能够从人类偏好数据中隐式学习自我改进，而无需提示。与提示方法相比，PIT在提高响应质量方面有很大的改进。通过利用人类偏好数据中的隐含指导，PIT能够自主地与人类偏好更好地对齐，从而无需人类参与。这为LLMs在扩展到新领域或未满足的用例时提供了一个有前景的方向。 </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>LLMs keep getting more capable at generating natural language. But there's always room for improving the quality and alignment of their responses.</p> <p>Typically this requires lots of human effort to collect more training data. So researchers are exploring ways for models to self-improve without human involvement.</p> <p>Many methods use prompting - giving the LLM instructions to critique and refine its responses. But coming up with comprehensive prompts is challenging.</p> <p>The new approach proposed, called PIT, lets models <strong>learn self-improvement implicitly from human preference data instead.</strong> It reformulates reinforcement learning to maximize the gap between an original response and improved response conditioned on the original.</p> <p>This taps into the implicit guidance in the preference data on what constitutes better quality, so no manual rubrics are needed. PIT uses curriculum reinforcement learning - first improving easy references, then switching to the LLM's own samples.</p> <p>Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show PIT significantly outperforms prompting methods like Self-Refine. It improved response quality 7-34% across conditions without any human involvement.</p> <p>This demonstrates a promising direction for LLMs to align better with human preferences autonomously as they learn from experience. No need for human bottlenecks when expanding to new domains or underserved use cases. Very cool!</p> <p><strong>TLDR: New method PIT enables LLMs to implicitly learn to refine themselves from human preference data, no prompts needed. Big improvement over prompting approaches.</strong></p> <p><a href="https://notes.aimodels.fyi/enabling-language-models-to-implicitly-learn-self-improvement/">Full Summary</a></p> <p>Arxiv is here: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00898">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00898</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Successful-Western27"> /u/Successful-Western27 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/16zvta7/new_paper_enabling_language_models_to_implicitly/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/16zvta7/new_paper_enabling_language_models_to_implicitly/">[comments]</a></span>

It’s a ton of repeating the same 3 questions, and only if they answer yes to all three do we move onto the actual sales.</p> <p>This seems like a perfect use case to utilize a voice-based AI model to pre-qualify inbound calls before they are passed onto a human.
