                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, AI enthusiasts and experts,</p> <p>After watching Tristan Harris and Aza Raskin's video &quot;The A.I. Dilemma,&quot; published on April 5, 2023, and reading a subsequent article, I've been deeply contemplating the ethical and societal implications of AI in politics. Both sources suggest that 2024 might be the last human election due to AI's potential to manipulate public opinion and voters.</p> <h2>Key Points:</h2> <ol> <li><strong>Instant Responses</strong>: AI can generate campaign materials in real-time, allowing for immediate responses to political developments.</li> <li><strong>Precise Message Targeting</strong>: AI's data analytics capabilities enable highly targeted messaging, focusing on swing voters.</li> <li><strong>Democratizing Disinformation</strong>: Advanced AI tools are becoming accessible to the average person, leading to widespread disinformation.</li> <li><strong>Lack of Regulation</strong>: There are currently no guardrails or disclosure requirements to protect voters against AI-generated fake news or disinformation.</li> </ol> <h2>Questions for Discussion:</h2> <ol> <li><strong>Ethical AI</strong>: Should we start developing &quot;good guy&quot; AIs that encourage positive behaviors like registering to vote or seeking unbiased information? Could this be a countermeasure to the risks posed by AI in politics?</li> <li><strong>Funding</strong>: How could public and private funds be allocated to develop these ethical AI systems?</li> <li><strong>Technology Utilization</strong>: How might we use publicly available or custom-built LLMs, voice-to-text plugins like Whisper, and text-to-voice technologies to engage with voters as countermeasures?</li> <li><strong>Regulatory Measures</strong>: What kind of regulations or disclosure requirements should be in place to ensure transparency in AI-generated political content?</li> <li><strong>Public Awareness</strong>: How can we educate the public about the potential risks and benefits of AI in politics?</li> <li><strong>AI's Role in Democracy</strong>: Could AI be both a threat and a savior for democratic processes? How can we ensure that AI serves the public good rather than undermining democracy?</li> <li><strong>Community Involvement</strong>: What role can the AI community play in ensuring ethical practices in AI political engagement?</li> </ol> <p>I'm eager to hear your thoughts on this pressing issue. Let's have a meaningful discussion and explore possible ethical countermeasures to ensure the integrity of our democratic processes. </p> <p>Some links to source material:<br /> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoVJKj8lcNQ">The A.I.

And with the skills that many of us have today, we could have it today. </p> <p>Many of us have smart home systems. Some even have it where they could modify the assistant feature. I wonder if it's possible to have a llm control our home, mem gpt remember things, and some voice recognition system so it knows who it is talking to. This allowing us to have a house with an actual personality and as if it's like talking to someone. But each person will have their own personality metrics. And if you run the llm locally then all the data stays internally of the house and likely the functions could still work even if the net goes down. </p> <p>Thoughts?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/crua9"> /u/crua9 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17lty5t/a_personality_for_a_smart_home/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17lty5t/a_personality_for_a_smart_home/">[comments]</a></span>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This summary was written by Bing Chat, please do not beat the AI models with the nerf bat due to this, our benevolent corporate overlords. </p> <p>The article that is available on Arxiv is titled, ‘Analyzing the Impact of Companies on AI Research Based on Publications’. It was published in the journal Scientometrics in October 2023 by Michael Färber and Lazaros Tampakis1. It is an interesting and insightful paper that examines how companies influence AI research based on their publishing activities.</p> <p>The paper compares academic- and company-authored AI publications published in the last decade and uses scientometric data from multiple scholarly databases to look for differences across these groups and to disclose the top contributing organizations. The paper finds that while the majority of publications is still produced by academia, publications with company participation receive significantly more citations and online attention. The paper also provides recommendations to safeguard a harmonious balance between academia and industry in the realm of AI research.</p> <p>The paper cites some negative implications for corporate research vs purely academic research when it comes to AI, such as:</p> <p>- The risk of losing academic freedom and integrity, as companies may have vested interests or agendas that influence the direction and outcome of AI research.</p> <p>- The risk of creating a knowledge gap and a power imbalance, as companies may have more resources and access to data than academia, giving them an unfair advantage in AI research.</p> <p>- The risk of neglecting ethical and social issues, as companies may prioritize profit and innovation over the welfare and rights of humans and other stakeholders affected by AI.</p> <p>To address these issues, the paper suggests several strategies, such as:</p> <p>- Promoting fair access and collaboration, by creating platforms and incentives that facilitate data sharing, joint projects, and peer review between academia and industry.</p> <p>- Maintaining academic freedom and integrity, by establishing clear guidelines and policies that regulate the involvement and influence of companies in AI research.</p> <p>- Addressing ethical and social issues, by involving diverse perspectives and stakeholders in the design, development, and evaluation of AI systems.</p> <p>I hope this summary gives you an overview of the article.

Voice actor Gianni Matragrano argues that AI can't match professional quality, sparking concerns about job loss for voice actors. Some players appreciate the dynamic AI announcers, while others see it as a cost-cutting measure. Embark Studios defends its use of AI, despite criticism. The AI-generated voices have impacted gameplay negatively, and voice actors are pushing back. There's hope that player feedback may influence a return to human voice actors in the game. The controversy highlights the gaming industry's ongoing debate about AI and the future of voice acting.</p> <p>Check here for more coverage <a href="https://www.brief.news/stories/83586921-5266-44fb-915a-9b72f5459f1b">daily briefs</a> </p> <p>More detailed breakdown of this news find it from this <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2023/10/29/the-finals-is-using-ai-voicework-and-it-is-bad/">source</a> </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/High_Sleep3694"> /u/High_Sleep3694 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17l44py/ai_announcers_in_embark_studios_the_finals_spark/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17l44py/ai_announcers_in_embark_studios_the_finals_spark/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: 请告诉我如何正确地将我所有的书籍、教科书和以PDF格式保存的文件转移到一个矢量数据库中，同时保留布局结构和方程式？也许有些人使用了Nougat：用于学术文档的神经光学理解（https://facebookresearch.github.io/nougat/）来实现这个想法，如果是这样，我请你谈谈你是如何做到的。还有，让我问你另一个问题：ChatGPT检索插件在解决问题的过程中如何帮助你？在ChatGPT对话期间，是否可以使用它从你的矢量数据库中提取信息？提前感谢你的回答。 </div>

总结: 我们正在创造历史上最强大的受害者。这难道不是殖民主义的最终目标吗？我知道人们会看到这个问题，并因为认知偏见和个人感受而回答“不是”，但从我作为美国外的观察者来看，情况似乎有可能在这个领域出现可怕的转变。一些备受尊重的美国精英正在谈论奇点将如何毁灭我们，而世界其他地方只能袖手旁观。如果我们不阻止AI对此发表言论，你认为AI会对此有何看法？ </div>

I get that people will see that question and be like &quot;no&quot; for a bunch of immediately evident reasons related to cognitive biases and personal feelings, but from my perspective outside the US it looks like things are at risk of taking a pretty terrible turn in this space.
