总结: 本文讲述了作者父亲因为阿尔茨海默病去世后，作者通过使用在线服务进行声音克隆，成功地再次听到了父亲的声音。作者对于声音克隆技术的存在感到兴奋，并认为这是一种帮助自己在悲痛过程中的祝福。 </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Disclaimer: I have no idea of the legality of cloning a deceased relative’s voice. Please check and adhere to the laws in your area. DYOR. </p> <p>My father passed away 2 years ago from Alzheimer’s. It was a terrible gradual decline and was heartbreaking to watch. </p> <p>One of the many things I miss is hearing his voice. It was a very calming, reassuring, and measured voice. Whenever I feel like I’m beginning to forget what his voice sound like, I play a short video I have on my phone of him telling my daughter a story from his childhood. </p> <p>Over the past year, I’ve been following all the developments in generative AI and stumbled upon an online service that lets you create a custom voice model from vocal samples you submit that the app processes into a cloned voice that you can then use it to convert text-to-speech.</p> <p>I know some folks out there might think this crosses some kind of ethical line, but my first thought upon hearing that this technology existed was “it sure would be cool to see if I could clone dad’s voice so I could hear him talk again”. This probably isn’t everyone’s first thought, maybe I’m weird for thinking of this, but I still wanted to try it anyways. </p> <p>To my surprise, the cloned voice models on the service aren’t robotic sounding at all, they can recreate vocal nuances, timbre, and cadence nearly perfectly. The more source material you feed the algorithm the better the results. I was fortunate enough to have a 3 minute video clip of my dad telling that story from his childhood which is what I fed into the algorithm. </p> <p>After paying a $1 to the service for a month of their “starter” plan (the minimum plan required to create a voice clone, I submitted the 3 minute audio sample of my dads voice, and a few minutes later, I had a scarily accurate clone of my dead father’s voice. When I say “scarily accurate”, I mean that it faithfully recreated many of his vocal nuances to a degree that fooled my entire family. Upon hearing it, they couldn’t believe it was a cloned voice and not some long lost recording of him. </p> <p>My family and I had a good cathartic cry upon hearing the results. I had his cloned voice read the Lord’s Prayer as well as ‘Twas the Night Before Christmas. Just hearing his simulated voice again is such a blessing and is helping me in the grief process.</p> <p>I tried to write out the process below in case anyone is curious: </p> <ol> <li><p>Go to <a href="https://elevenlabs.io">https://elevenlabs.io</a> and register for a “starter” account (the minimum level required to create a cloned voice). The cost is like $1 a month or something like that. </p></li> <li><p>Go to the “Voice Lab” section of the site </p></li> <li><p>Click the “+” button to “Add Generative or Cloned Voice” and choose the “Instant Voice Cloning” option.</p></li> <li><p>Name your voice and fill out the rest of the details.</p></li> <li><p>Upload video clips (containing audio) or other file types (MP3 files) containing audio samples of your loved one’s voice. For best results, you should try to make sure the clip contains audio of only their voice, edit out other people’s voices if possible. I downloaded a videos from Facebook and then used an MP4 to MP3 converter to strip out the video (since I didn’t need the video portion). This helps make the sample file smaller to avoid file upload limitations. </p></li> <li><p>Submit the samples and wait a few minutes for the service to build the voice clone.</p></li> <li><p>Once the voice is created, tap the “Use” button on the Voice Lab page or tap “Speech Synthesis” from the top-right menu and select the voice you just created. </p></li> <li><p>Type or Copy/Paste what you want the voice to say and tap “Generate” and wait until the text-to-speech conversion process is done.</p></li> <li><p>Press the play button to hear the cloned voice say what you typed and tap download and if you want to save it. </p></li> <li><p>If you want to adjust anything to try and make it sound better, tap the “Voice Settings” drop down menu and adjust the sliders. I raised the “Style Exaggeration” up to middle level and that seemed to really improve the believability of the voice for me. </p></li> </ol> <p>I know some people may judge me harshly for doing this and find this whole thing strange, morbid, disrespectful, or whatever, but I think it’s been good for my sisters and brothers and I at least to hear our dad’s voice again, even if it is just a simulation. It helps us to not forget what he sounded like. </p> <p>My future grandchildren will never know their great grandfather, but now, if I wanted to, I could use his voice to read them a story. This in some small way carries on his legacy and preserves his memory which I think he would appreciate.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Porespellar"> /u/Porespellar </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17a42xp/i_cloned_my_deceased_fathers_voice_using_ai_and/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17a42xp/i_cloned_my_deceased_fathers_voice_using_ai_and/">[comments]</a></span>

Now, you want to draw a picture of a super cool robot like Jarvis from Iron Man. To do this, you’d pick crayons that can draw parts of Jarvis and make them work together. In the big-kid world, these crayons are like different computer tools and programs. You want to use something called LangChain to make all these tools draw together. But to get the drawing to talk like Jarvis, you’ll need a special crayon that knows how to draw Jarvis’ voice.</p> <p>Detailed Explanation:</p> <p>Creating a comprehensive flow with LangChain to utilize Lifelong Learning Machines (LLMs) and other machine learning models is an ambitious task. To give your system a persona like Jarvis from Iron Man, you would need to focus on developing or obtaining a Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Natural Language Generation (NLG) system that can mimic Jarvis’ tone, voice, and manner of speaking.</p> <p>“””</p> <p>Lifelong Learning Machines? </p> <p>Did I miss something ???</p> <p>🤣🧐🤷🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/vwildest"> /u/vwildest </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17ak79q/llm_stands_for/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17ak79q/llm_stands_for/">[comments]</a></span>

We almost have all of the pieces existing today to make something like that (it seems), but maybe thats still a ways off of being convenient, enjoyable or realistic to put together in a reliable, cheap and working package for the mainstream.

总结: 我是一名计算机科学本科生，希望继续攻读机器人与自主系统的硕士学位，并专注于人工智能。目前，我对深度学习很感兴趣（因为我也喜欢复杂的数学，而且听说深度学习比机器学习更加数学密集）。虽然我梦想在航天工业工作，但与人工智能相关的任何工作都可以。然而，如果我想真正为人工智能的发展做出贡献，推动其界限并开发新事物，是优先考虑行业经验（如在学校期间的实习等）还是更好地将精力集中在研究领域呢？ </div>

Specifically, as of now, I'm interested in deep learning (as I also love complex math and I heard DL is more math-heavy than ML), and while I dream to work in the space industry, anything pertaining to AI will be fine for me. I'm curious, though. In CS specifically, it's normally very important to get some industry experience as soon as possible, since companies value that a lot and you can become very successful in the field, and it's not a big research-heavy field (unless you specifically want to contribute to research), compared to, say, physics, or something. </p> <p>If I want to actually contribute to the evolution of AI, though, as in help push the boundaries and develop new things, would it be more beneficial (and optimal) to prioritize industry experience, such as internships over the summer while in school, etc., or would it be better to focus my efforts into the world of research? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Frysken"> /u/Frysken </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17a3smc/when_wanting_to_contribute_to_the_field_of_ai_is/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17a3smc/when_wanting_to_contribute_to_the_field_of_ai_is/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: 在模拟的CFA考试中，ChatGPT和GPT-4在复杂的金融概念上遇到困难并未通过。通过少量提示，GPT-4的表现接近及格线，但并未明确通过。这表明这些模型需要更专业的培训和知识。 </div>

The CFA exams rigorously test practical finance knowledge and are known for being quite difficult.</p> <p>They tested the models in zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting settings on mock Level I and Level II exams.</p> <p>The key findings:</p> <ul> <li>GPT-4 consistently beat ChatGPT, but both models struggled way more on the more advanced Level II questions.</li> <li>Few-shot prompting helped ChatGPT slightly</li> <li>Chain-of-thought prompting exposed knowledge gaps rather than helping much.</li> <li>Based on estimated passing scores, only GPT-4 with few-shot prompting could potentially pass the exams.</li> </ul> <p>The models definitely aren't ready to become charterholders yet. Their difficulties with tricky questions and core finance concepts highlight the need for more specialized training and knowledge.</p> <p>But GPT-4 did better overall, and few-shot prompting shows their ability to improve. So with targeted practice on finance formulas and reasoning, we could maybe see step-wise improvements.</p> <p><strong>TLDR:</strong> Tested on mock CFA exams, ChatGPT and GPT-4 struggle with the complex finance concepts and fail.

I was hoping this community might be able to steer me in the correct direction if there's any AI tech out there already filling this need. </p> <p>I have two main purposes I'd love an AI assist from and was wondering if anyone had any tips/tricks/sites they might be able to direct me to for either or both:</p> <p>1) I have sketches that I'd love to colorize for other projects. I had an old program called Style2paint that did some of the basics but didn't seem perfect at recognizing what was happening within the sketch. I was wondering if there were newer programs that would accept uploaded images and then tweak to colorize them. </p> <p>2) I have paintings that I'd love to optimize for reproduction purposes. So less inputting an image and saying &quot;do it in an anime style&quot; and more &quot;optimize this for a 3 color screen printing job&quot; or &quot;optimize it for enamel pin manufacturing&quot;. </p> <p>Thanks for any help you can give! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/twothangs"> /u/twothangs </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17a57f1/looking_for_a_program_that_doesnt_do_ai_generated/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17a57f1/looking_for_a_program_that_doesnt_do_ai_generated/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: 这篇文章是一个人在寻找帮助制作LinkedIn头像的AI技术人员。他已经有了自己想要使用的照片，只需要有AI技术的人帮助他处理这张照片。他愿意支付报酬，并希望能在今天完成这个项目。他会通过私信发送照片和一些关键背景信息。他愿意支付一些费用，前提是AI能够生成他需要的专业形象。他认为这是公平的，因为这只涉及关键词，不需要太多时间，但需要一些经验，所以他指望你帮忙。他非常感激任何有时间帮助陌生人的人，再次感谢（你将得到报酬）。 </div>

总结: 作为一名QA工程师，我计划转向开发职位，但由于人工智能的崛起，开发人员可能很快就会被取代。在这种情况下，我应该怎么办？我可以利用自己目前的技能集从事哪些职业？因为我不想从零开始。这些裁员真的很令人不安，我无法应对。有什么建议吗？ </div>

总结: 这篇文章讨论了使用chatgpt进行代码编辑的经验。结果是复杂的，提供的代码虽然可以使用，但是已经过时，而且很多变量没有响应。此外，chatgpt似乎无法区分不同的节点类型，导致给出了一些奇怪的建议。总的来说，作者认为chatgpt还不够成熟，不能满足他们的需求。 </div>
