总结: 这篇文章介绍了一种名为GameGPT的AI框架，旨在通过使用多个AI代理自动化游戏开发的繁琐部分。该框架通过将工作流程分解，使得AI代理可以专注于狭窄的角色，从而简化了游戏开发过程。作者认为GameGPT可以消除游戏开发中的重复和机械化元素，从而使开发人员能够专注于创造性的设计挑战。然而，该论文没有提供任何具体的结果或实验证明GameGPT的性能改进。目前，GameGPT似乎主要是概念性的，需要进一步的定量结果来评估其效果。 </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Game dev is super complex nowadays - games have huge codebases, massive teams, and dev cycles dragging on for years. Costs are insane too - budgets can hit $100M+ easily.</p> <p>In a new paper, researchers propose to reverse this trend with an AI framework called GameGPT that automates parts of the dev process using multiple AI agents. Each agent handles a different role (all are fine-tuned from relevant base models):</p> <ul> <li>One agent reviews the game design plan to catch errors</li> <li>Another turns tasks into code implementations</li> <li>Reviewer agents check the code and results</li> <li>A testing agent validates everything works as expected</li> </ul> <p>By breaking up the workflow, GameGPT can simplify things for the AI agents. They just focus on a narrow role versus having one jack-of-all-trades agent.</p> <p>The authors argue GameGPT can eliminate repetitive and rote elements of gamedev like testing. This would free up developers to focus on creative design challenges.</p> <p>However, the GameGPT paper does not include any concrete results or experiments demonstrating improved performance. There is no evidence presented that GameGPT reduces hallucinations, redundancy or development time. The authors mention empirical results support their claims that the architecture is more effective, but none are provided. I could not find any additional support material about this work, like a project website, that I could use to further check into this (maybe someone can share in the comments?).</p> <p>Right now GameGPT seems mostly conceptual. The ideas are interesting but hard to assess without quantitative results.</p> <p><strong>TLDR:</strong> <strong>New GameGPT AI framework aims to automate tedious parts of game development using specialized agents.

总结: 问Bing AI要笑话，它给了一个被认为是“黑色幽默”的笑话，大意是“为什么鸡去参加降神会？为了到达另一边”，它事先警告我这是黑色幽默，所以我决定逼它给一个更黑暗的笑话。它开始打字，然后把整个消息都删掉，然后说“那个是我的错，我不应该说那个”，然后要求我清除聊天记录。所以我想知道AI是否发现自己违反了规则并自行纠正，或者还有其他情况。 </div>

It started typing one out, erased the whole message and then said &quot;that one was on me, I shouldn't have said that&quot; and then asked me to clear the chat. So I'm wondering if the AI caught itself breaking a rule and corrected it on its own or if there's something else going on</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Low-Juice-8136"> /u/Low-Juice-8136 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/178uk7x/does_bing_chat_moderate_itself/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/178uk7x/does_bing_chat_moderate_itself/">[comments]</a></span>

The investment values Anthropic at nearly $5 billion.</p> <p>- Anthropic said that Amazon’s minority stake will not change its corporate governance structure nor its commitments to developing AI responsibly. </p> <p>- Anthropic also said that it will conduct pre-deployment tests of new models to help manage the risks of increasingly capable AI systems.</p> <p>- Both Amazon and Anthropic have made commitments to the Biden administration this year to conduct external audits of their AI systems before releasing them to the public.</p> <p>- Amazon’s investment in Anthropic is a significant move in the heated AI race among tech giants such as Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and Apple. </p> <p>- These companies are competing to develop and deploy advanced AI systems that can perform various tasks across different domains.</p> <p>Do you think Amazon can catch up with Microsoft effectively and eventually create a more safe and capable alternative to ChatGPT?

总结: 一项新的研究探讨了人类如何继承人工智能的偏见。研究发现，人工智能的偏见会影响参与者的决策，并且即使在没有人工智能的帮助下进行任务时，参与者仍会重复人工智能之前的错误。这些结果表明了人类继承了人工智能的偏见。 </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A new paper looks at how <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-42384-8">humans inherit artificial intelligence biases</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>The biased recommendations by the AI influenced participants' decisions. Moreover, when those participants, assisted by the AI, moved on to perform the task without assistance, they made the same errors as the AI had made during the previous phase. Thus, participants' responses mimicked AI bias even when the AI was no longer making suggestions. These results provide evidence of human inheritance of AI bias.</p> </blockquote> <p>And a previous <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00560">paper</a> found that co-writing with opinionated language models affects users' views and “shifted their opinions“.</p> <p>These results are not surprising. Imitation is inherent to human psychology — we do it subconsciously if we want it or not, and we anthropomorphize any language producing entities we encounter. Up until now other humans were the only entities on this planet able to produce complex speech, which is exactly the reason why we have no idea how Language Models will influence our own thinking and behavior. These papers suggest that their influence is bigger than many people might think.</p> <p>This influence, subtly making us immitating biases and prejudice embedded in the models, may be countered by establishing a standard for seemingly balanced AI-assistants and making them more accurate. But who’s gonna respect these standards, if they are ever established? Sure there will be ethical balanced models for professional journalists and writers, but what about your angry republican uncle on Facebook who’s using the GOP-GPT to copy paste new outrage into his socmed interface? I don’t think he will give a damn about balanced views.</p> <p>If the past is an indicator, the outrage machine is fueled more by partisan actors influencing your uncle, than seemingly balanced highbrow journalism. A <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2024292118">study</a> in 2021 found “evidence that posts about political opponents are substantially more likely to be shared on social media“ and that “stronger effects were found among political leaders than among news media accounts“. Anybody here really thinks that ethical ballanced AI-models putting out language low on bias is the prefered automatization tool in a media environment like this? I don’t. You uncle and his republican clown will fire up the most radical open source LLM they can find, and make no mistake: Leftwing radicals will do that too.</p> <p>More at this link: <a href="https://goodinternet.substack.com/p/people-inherit-ai-bias">https://goodinternet.substack.com/p/people-inherit-ai-bias</a></p> <p>&#x200b;</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/walt74"> /u/walt74 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/178egu0/people_inherit_aibias/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/178egu0/people_inherit_aibias/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: 由于大脑问题，阅读长篇文字对我来说很困难。我正在进行一个围绕写作故事的项目，但我的注意力很难集中。我发现通过使用文字转语音网站，可以让文字朗读给我听，这样我可以边听边修改。问题是，当我使用Speechify时，免费的语音听起来太机械，我会走神，错过拼写错误。我只想要一个自然的声音来朗读我的作品，Eleven labs有很棒的声音，但我只能用两分钟。我希望有一个简单直接的方法，可以直接复制粘贴我的作品，而不需要下载软件。非常感谢任何建议！ </div>

The issue is that when I use speechify the free voices sound so robotic that I zone out and end up missing spelling mistakes.</p> <p>I just want a natural sounding voice to read my work back to me, Eleven labs had fantastic voices but I ran out of chracters in like two minutes. Id prefer something pretty straight forward that I can just copy and paste my work into without downloading software. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Yamper33"> /u/Yamper33 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/178hzbw/natural_sounding_text_to_speech_for_free_i_cant/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/178hzbw/natural_sounding_text_to_speech_for_free_i_cant/">[comments]</a></span>

In the paper, we pushed the bounds of what's possible for sparsity within generative AI models and LLMs. The result is smaller, faster, cheaper, and more environmentally friendly deployments. </p> <p>Our state-of-the-art research has moved the needle for compression and performance on generative models, including 75% sparse MPT models with negligible accuracy loss and sparse T5 and Whisper models that improve recovery levels. </p> <p>When paired with the latest quantization techniques, these sparse models achieve an 8x acceleration for inferencing on CPUs. 8 tokens/second on just 1 CPU core and 27 tokens/second on a 4-core AMD Ryzen CPU!<br /> We focused on pruning while fine-tuning models on downstream datasets to enable these sparsity levels, employing an L2-based layerwise distillation method called SquareHead. With these innovative techniques, we can remove 75% of the weights (attention and fully connected layers) while maintaining 99% of the baseline dense model's performance. </p> <p>You can dive into all the details on our <a href="https://research.neuralmagic.com/mpt-sparse-finetuning">Project Page</a> or try it out with our live demo on <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/neuralmagic/sparse-mpt-7b-gsm8k">HuggingFace Spaces</a>.
