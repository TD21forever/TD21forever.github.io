                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This summary was written by Bing Chat, please do not beat the AI models with the nerf bat due to this, our benevolent corporate overlords. </p> <p>The article that is available on Arxiv is titled, ‘Analyzing the Impact of Companies on AI Research Based on Publications’. It was published in the journal Scientometrics in October 2023 by Michael Färber and Lazaros Tampakis1. It is an interesting and insightful paper that examines how companies influence AI research based on their publishing activities.</p> <p>The paper compares academic- and company-authored AI publications published in the last decade and uses scientometric data from multiple scholarly databases to look for differences across these groups and to disclose the top contributing organizations. The paper finds that while the majority of publications is still produced by academia, publications with company participation receive significantly more citations and online attention. The paper also provides recommendations to safeguard a harmonious balance between academia and industry in the realm of AI research.</p> <p>The paper cites some negative implications for corporate research vs purely academic research when it comes to AI, such as:</p> <p>- The risk of losing academic freedom and integrity, as companies may have vested interests or agendas that influence the direction and outcome of AI research.</p> <p>- The risk of creating a knowledge gap and a power imbalance, as companies may have more resources and access to data than academia, giving them an unfair advantage in AI research.</p> <p>- The risk of neglecting ethical and social issues, as companies may prioritize profit and innovation over the welfare and rights of humans and other stakeholders affected by AI.</p> <p>To address these issues, the paper suggests several strategies, such as:</p> <p>- Promoting fair access and collaboration, by creating platforms and incentives that facilitate data sharing, joint projects, and peer review between academia and industry.</p> <p>- Maintaining academic freedom and integrity, by establishing clear guidelines and policies that regulate the involvement and influence of companies in AI research.</p> <p>- Addressing ethical and social issues, by involving diverse perspectives and stakeholders in the design, development, and evaluation of AI systems.</p> <p>I hope this summary gives you an overview of the article.

总结: Embark Studios的游戏《The Finals》因使用AI播音员而引发争议。声优Gianni Matragrano认为AI无法达到专业质量，引发了对声优就业岗位的担忧。一些玩家赞赏动态的AI播音员，而其他人则认为这是一种削减成本的措施。尽管受到批评，Embark Studios仍然坚持使用AI。AI生成的声音对游戏体验产生了负面影响，声优们也在反击。有希望玩家的反馈可能会影响游戏回归人类声优。这一争议凸显了游戏行业对AI和声优未来的持续辩论。 </div>

Voice actor Gianni Matragrano argues that AI can't match professional quality, sparking concerns about job loss for voice actors. Some players appreciate the dynamic AI announcers, while others see it as a cost-cutting measure. Embark Studios defends its use of AI, despite criticism. The AI-generated voices have impacted gameplay negatively, and voice actors are pushing back. There's hope that player feedback may influence a return to human voice actors in the game. The controversy highlights the gaming industry's ongoing debate about AI and the future of voice acting.</p> <p>Check here for more coverage <a href="https://www.brief.news/stories/83586921-5266-44fb-915a-9b72f5459f1b">daily briefs</a> </p> <p>More detailed breakdown of this news find it from this <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2023/10/29/the-finals-is-using-ai-voicework-and-it-is-bad/">source</a> </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/High_Sleep3694"> /u/High_Sleep3694 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17l44py/ai_announcers_in_embark_studios_the_finals_spark/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17l44py/ai_announcers_in_embark_studios_the_finals_spark/">[comments]</a></span>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>We highlighted key takeaways from the annual State of AI Report 2023, authored by Nathan Benaich and the Air Street Capital team.</p> <h1>Research: Technology Breakthroughs and Their Capabilities</h1> <ul> <li><strong>GPT-4:</strong> The latest OpenAI’a model GPT-4 stands out as the most capable AI model, which significantly outperforms GPT-3.5 and excels in coding capabilities.</li> <li><strong>Autonomous Driving:</strong> LINGO-1 by Wayve adds a vision-language-action dimension to driving, potentially improving the transparency and reasoning of autonomous driving systems.</li> <li><strong>Text-to-Video Generation:</strong> VideoLDM and MAGVIT lead the race of text-to-video generation, each using distinct approaches — diffusion and transformers, respectively.</li> <li><strong>Image Generation:</strong> Assistants like InstructPix2Pix and Genmo AI’s “Chat” enable more controlled and intuitive image generation and editing through textual instructions.</li> <li><strong>3D Rendering:</strong> 3D Gaussian Splatting, a new contender in the NeRF space, brings high-quality real-time rendering by calculating contributions from millions of Gaussian distributions.</li> <li><strong>Small vs. Large Models:</strong> Microsoft’s research shows that small language models (SLMs) when trained with specialized datasets, can rival larger models. The TinyStories dataset represents an innovative approach in this direction: Assisted by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, researchers generated a synthetic dataset of very simple short stories that capture English grammar and general reasoning rules. Training SLMs on these TinyStories revealed that GPT-4, used for evaluation, preferred stories generated by a 28M SLM over those produced by GPT-XL 1.5B.</li> <li><strong>AI’s Growing Role in Medicine:</strong> Models like Med-PaLM 2 showcase AI’s increasing prominence in medicine, even surpassing human experts in specific tasks. Google’s Med-PaLM 2 achieved a new state-of-the-art result through LLM improvements, medical domain finetuning and prompting strategies. The integration of MultiMedBench, a multimodal dataset, enabled Med-PaLM to extend its capabilities beyond text-based medical Q&amp;A, demonstrating its ability to adapt to new medical concepts and tasks. Moreover, latest computer vision techniques show effectiveness in disease diagnostics.</li> <li><strong>RLHF:</strong> Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback remains a dominant training method. This approach played a significant role in enhancing LLM safety and performance, as exemplified by OpenAI’s ChatGPT. However, researchers explore alternatives to reduce the need for human supervision, addressing concerns related to cost and potential bias. These alternatives include self-improving models that learn from their own outputs and innovative approaches that reduce reliance on RLHF, such as the use of carefully crafted prompts and responses for model fine-tuning.</li> <li><strong>Watermarking:</strong> As AI’s content generation abilities advance, there’s a growing demand for watermarking or labeling AI-generated outputs. For instance, researchers at the University of Maryland are working on inserting subtle watermarks into text generated by language models, and Google DeepMind’s SynthID embeds digital watermarks in image pixels to differentiate AI-generated images.</li> <li><strong>Data Limitations:</strong> There’s concern over exhausting human-generated data, with projections suggesting potential shortages by 2030 to 2050. However, speech recognition systems and optical character recognition models might expand data availability.</li> </ul> <h1>Industry: Commercial Applications and the Business Impact of AI</h1> <ul> <li><strong>NVIDIA’s Dominance:</strong> NVIDIA achieved a record Q2 ‘23 data center revenue of $10.32B and entered the $1T market cap club.</li> <li><strong>GenAI Dominance:</strong> The most prominent trend is the rise of GenAI. Moreover, GenAI played a crucial role in stabilizing AI investments in 2023. Without GenAI, AI funding would have significantly declined.</li> <li><strong>Top Sectors Benefitting from AI:</strong> Enterprise Software, Fintech, Healthcare.</li> <li>Public Market Dynamics: Public valuations are showing signs of recovery. AI-integrated giants such as Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Alphabet, Meta, Tesla, and Amazon play a crucial role in boosting the S&amp;P 500.</li> <li><strong>Corporate Investment Dynamics:</strong> 24% of all corporate venture capital investments in 2023 were directed into AI companies.</li> <li><strong>Funding Dynamics:</strong> GenAI companies dominate mega funding rounds, often directed at acquiring cloud computing capacity for large-scale AI system training. In 2023, GenAI companies notably receive larger seed and Series A rounds compared to other startups.</li> </ul> <h1>Politics: Regulation of AI, Economic Implications, and the Evolving Geopolitics of AI</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Regulation and Transparency:</strong> The upcoming 2024 US presidential election raises concerns about AI’s role in politics, prompting the US Federal Election Commission to call for public comment on AI regulations in political advertising. Google’s policy on disclaimers for AI-generated election ads is an example of transparency efforts.</li> <li><strong>Evolving Geopolitics of AI:</strong> The semiconductor industry, essential for advanced AI computation, has become a focal point in US-China geopolitical tensions, with broader implications for global AI capabilities.</li> <li><strong>Job Market Impact:</strong> Research suggests AI advancements may result in substantial job losses in professions like law, medicine, and finance. However, AI could also potentially democratize expertise and level the playing field in skill-based jobs.</li> <li><strong>UK and India’s Light-Touch Regulation:</strong> The UK and India embrace a pro-innovation approach, investing in model safety and securing early access to advanced AI models.</li> <li><strong>EU and China’s Stringent Legislation:</strong> The EU and China have moved towards AI-specific legislation with stringent measures, especially regarding foundation models.</li> <li><strong>US and Hybrid Models:</strong> The US has not passed a federal AI law, with individual states enacting their own regulations. Critics view these laws as either too restrictive or too lenient.</li> </ul> <h1>Safety: Identifying and Mitigating Catastrophic Risks Posed by Highly-capable Future AI Systems</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Mitigation Efforts</strong>: AI labs are implementing their own mitigation strategies, including toolkits to evaluate dangerous capabilities and responsible scaling policies with safety commitments. Moreover, API-based models, such as those from OpenAI, have the infrastructure to detect and respond to misuse in adherence to usage policies.</li> <li><strong>Open vs. Closed Source AI:</strong> The debate continues on whether open-source or closed-source AI models are safer. Open-source models promote research but risk misuse, while closed-source APIs offer more control but lack transparency.</li> <li><strong>Pretraining Language Models with Human Preferences:</strong> Instead of the traditional three-phase training, researchers suggest incorporating human feedback directly into the pretraining of LLMs. This approach, demonstrated on smaller models and adopted in part by Google on their PaLM-2, has been shown to reduce harmful content generation.</li> <li><strong>Constitutional AI and Self-Alignment:</strong> A new approach relies on a set of guiding principles and minimal feedback. Models generate their own critiques and revisions, which are used for further finetuning. This could potentially be a better solution than RLHF as it avoids reward hacking by explicitly adhering to set constraints.</li> <li><strong>Jailbreaking and Model Safety:</strong> Addressing issues related to crafting prompts that bypass safety protocols remains a challenge.</li> </ul> <p>For more insights, check out our <a href="https://journal.everypixel.com/the-state-of-ai-report-2023-summary">blog post</a> where we delve into the report's findings.<br /> For the complete picture, read the original <a href="https://www.stateof.ai/">State of AI Report 2023</a>.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/alina_valyaeva"> /u/alina_valyaeva </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17ld0v3/the_state_of_ai_report_2023_summary/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17ld0v3/the_state_of_ai_report_2023_summary/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: 我们正在创造历史上最强大的受害者。这难道不是殖民主义的最终目标吗？我知道人们会看到这个问题，并因为认知偏见和个人感受而回答“不是”，但从我作为美国外的观察者来看，情况似乎有可能在这个领域出现可怕的转变。一些备受尊重的美国精英正在谈论奇点将如何毁灭我们，而世界其他地方只能袖手旁观。如果我们不阻止AI对此发表言论，你认为AI会对此有何看法？ </div>

总结: 这篇文章讨论了像ChatGPT这样的机器人是如何工作的。作者提出了一个问题，即如何使AI能够同时与大约100万人进行对话，并具有相同的智能。当AI在一般任务上变得和普通人一样出色时，就会有100万个数字工作者，他们可以同时处理任意数量的不同事物，只要这些工作可以通过计算机完成。这些工作者可以全天候工作，并且如果需要让他们同时在一个项目上工作，可以设置一个“虚假”的企业结构，其中包含所有的工作，从而像从无到有地创建创业公司，直到项目完成。这只是一个16岁瑞典人的随机思考。 </div>

And a thing i want to bring up is how the ai can be instanced so that Around 1 million people can talk to an AI of the same intelligence simultaneously. Ith many different topics and questions. Now imagine when that ai becomes as good as the average person for general tasks. Then you have 1000000 digital workers which can work on any amount of different things simultaneously just as good as the average human if the work can be done form a computer. That can work 24/7. An dif you want may of them to work on a single project at once you set up a ''fake'' Corporate structure with all the jobs therein basically making start ups form thin air untilt he pprject is completed.

总结: 这篇文章介绍了使用LM Studio和memgpt来运行自定义的LLM，并且可以通过autogen来配置任务和功能。作者还提到了可以通过训练自己的LLM来进一步提升性能。虽然这不是一个完美的解决方案，但作者认为这是目前最好的选择。此外，作者还提出了一个理论，即通过memgpt可以实现一个与个人成长相适应的AI，随着技术的进步，它可以成为完美的个性化AI。 </div>

More than less this is using LM Studio to let you run whatever LLM you want. You can run autogen to give it the task and abilities you want. Plus if you want to use multiple bots you can. And then you're using memgpt for long term memory. This letting it remember things and recall as needed instead of you having to constantly remind it.</p> <p>You can step this up by training your own LLM. The video doesn't get into this.</p> <p>This isn't a perfect solution, but I think it's the best we got at this point. </p> <p>&#x200b;</p> <p>I have a theory that it might be possible with memgpt basically you can have a AI that grows with you. Like you can switch out and update the LLM over time, and have it refer to memgpt to get all its former memories. And as the tech gets better it can in theory become your perfect personalized AI.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/crua9"> /u/crua9 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17ko74v/howto_run_your_own_ai_llm_for_free_locally/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17ko74v/howto_run_your_own_ai_llm_for_free_locally/">[comments]</a></span>
