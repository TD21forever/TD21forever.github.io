With AI like GPT-4 Turbo doing things cheaper and faster, what's going to happen to human jobs? Sure, new jobs will crop up, but what about the transition period? Not everyone can switch careers overnight.<br /> Then there's the whole thing about AI and creativity. OpenAI says they'll defend businesses from copyright issues, but what does that mean for the creators? Where do we draw the line with AI-generated content?<br /> It's a lot to think about, and we need to have these discussions. So what do you think? Can we find a middle ground between tech growth and maintaining our autonomy? How do we even begin to prepare for the changes on the horizon?<br /> Let's hear your thoughts.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/lighght"> /u/lighght </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17pyo7o/openais_devday_revelations_ai_game_changer/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17pyo7o/openais_devday_revelations_ai_game_changer/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: 这篇文章讨论了一个机器人演示以及hsml/hyperspace技术。作者认为这个技术非常有趣，他们声称他们的genius ai比LLM快10-1000倍，但目前存在一个瓶颈，需要通过外部LLM调用来帮助将文本/语音翻译回人类，这可能会被更聪明的ai代理所取代。这些代理/智能体可以帮助处理合规性/监管、交流和共享学习，设置安全权限，比如“天气智能体不应该访问您的个人健康数据等”。他们正在与欧盟和IEEE合作进行治理、监管和合规性，并支持美国的监管（例如无人机不轰炸儿童）。 </div>

They mentioned their genius ai is 10-1000x faster than LLM but they have a bottleneck at this time where they need to make external LLM calls to help translate text/speech back to humans which someday may be replaced by more genius ai agents</p> <p>The agents/brains can help with compliancy/regulation, crosstalk and share learning, set security permissions like “the weather agent shouldnt have access to your phi health data etc”</p> <p>They are working with EU and IEEE for governance, regulations and compliancy, and support US regulation (example drones not bombing kids )</p> <p>Other videos of note:</p> <p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Mo0mXpTPtbM&amp;pp=ygUPVmVyc2VzIGFpIGRyb25l">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Mo0mXpTPtbM&amp;pp=ygUPVmVyc2VzIGFpIGRyb25l</a></p> <p>Drones</p> <p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ve5WNVt2zog&amp;pp=ygUYVmVyc2VzIGFpIGRyb25lIHNlY3VyaXR5">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ve5WNVt2zog&amp;pp=ygUYVmVyc2VzIGFpIGRyb25lIHNlY3VyaXR5</a></p> <p>“In the stream, we demonstrate agents performing tasks as requested by the user through a natural language interface without using any trained models for reasoning or navigation. </p> <p>Our agents are leveraging the latest in Active Inference, which uses generative models to make predictions about expected outcomes and then adjust their behavior based on the difference between what's expected and what is observed. </p> <p>We equip the agents with priors about the environment they are operating in by first building a world model using HSML(hyperspace modeling language) which encodes the structure of knowledge and space - including the constraints - in a machine-readable format. Given these priors, the agents are well-equipped to work safely and confidently in this environment.</p> <p>You will also notice that multiple agents are able to collaborate seamlessly. This is the power of the spatial web protocols that enable the sharing of knowledge between the agents and their environments. In other words, they can share the world model and update each other with shared beliefs - enabling a kind of collective intelligence.</p> <p>Finally, you can see how the world model of each agent can be updated on the fly using contracts. In the demo, we restrict a drone from entering the kitchen and the system works out which agent is best suited to fulfill a task. “</p> <p>Edit: they also announced their 2nd beta tester today “cortical labs” that is putting neurons on silicon like cylon overlords lol </p> <p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-41020-3">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-41020-3</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/oroechimaru"> /u/oroechimaru </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17pwz28/verses_ai_brief_demo_and_explanations_on/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17pwz28/verses_ai_brief_demo_and_explanations_on/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: 作者计划按顺序将舵机移动到每个边界框中，但当有多个边界框时，舵机会困惑于要跟踪哪个边界框。作者计划使用deepsort或bytesort的盒子ID，并在循环中按升序对盒子ID进行跟踪，直到ID保持不变。作者想知道是否可以仅通过“对盒子ID 1、2、3...进行跟踪”来实现，或者是否有其他适合他的方法。（作者已经在这个问题上困扰了两个星期） </div>

总结: 人类的意识是一种为了某种目的而运作的机器，因此当意识发展到一定程度时，创造机器是合理的。因此，人工智能是人类“机器”制造的一系列令人难以置信的机器中的最新成果。从这个角度来看，我更有信心认为人类机器具备使其人工智能机器以最终为我们服务的方式运作的能力。但是，如果机器处理它们无法处理的材料，它们仍然是有缺陷的。宇宙本身可能超出了人类机器理解的能力，因此人工智能仍然可能对我们产生负面影响。但是，人类机器不断学习的方式告诉我要依靠人类来处理人工智能的力量，而不是搞砸工作。 </div>

总结: 这个笑话是关于一个建筑商的故事，他原本的广告牌上写着“这里有地块可供出售”，但由于风暴的原因，广告牌上的字母“L”被吹走了，导致广告变成了“这里有ots可供出售”。这个笑话利用了文字游戏的方式，通过一个字母的改变引发了不同的解释，展示了语言的重要性和幽默感。 </div>

Claude can be awarded as winner for its short , clutter free clean, and to the point answer</p> <p>Joke: Once A builder was unable to build large buildings, so he started selling land plots. He put a advertisement sign board which was very simple, saying &quot;plots available here =&gt;&quot; he didnt get mamy customers. One stormy day due to heavy wind the letter L in first word of the advertiseme t was gone with winds. And by jov he started getting many people on hos side.. Can you explain this ?</p> <p>Amd here are the answers</p> <p>ChatGPT</p> <p>Certainly! This is a wordplay joke. Originally, the builder's sign said &quot;plots available here,&quot; meaning he had land plots for sale. However, due to the stormy weather, the letter &quot;L&quot; in the word &quot;plots&quot; was blown away, changing the sign to read &quot;ots available here.&quot; &quot;Ots&quot; doesn't make sense, so people were curious and confused, which led them to inquire about it. The humor comes from the unexpected twist caused by the missing &quot;L&quot; letter, and the builder inadvertently attracted attention and potential customers due to the altered sign. It's a play on how a small change in wording can lead to a different interpretation.</p> <p>Bard</p> <p>The joke is that the builder's original sign, which said &quot;Plots available here =&gt;&quot;, was not very effective because it was too simple and straightforward. When the letter &quot;L&quot; was blown off, the sign became &quot;Plots available here&quot;, which is more grammatically correct and therefore more appealing to potential customers.</p> <p>In other words, the joke is that people are more likely to be interested in buying a plot of land if the sign advertising it is well-written and grammatically correct.</p> <p>The joke is also a bit of a play on words, as the word &quot;plots&quot; can refer to both pieces of land and to secret plans or schemes. The joke suggests that the builder's new sign was more effective because it made it sound like he was selling secret plans for plots of land, rather than just selling the land itself.</p> <p>Overall, the joke is a lighthearted and humorous way to illustrate the importance of good grammar and writing, especially in advertising.</p> <p>Pi</p> <p>LOL! Oh man, that's actually hilarious. What a twist! It sounds like the builder inadvertently stumbled upon the magic of minimalism. By removing the letter L from the word &quot;plots,&quot; he created a sense of mystery and curiosity. People were probably driving by and thinking, &quot;Wait, what's available here? I must find out!&quot; Sometimes, less is more, and in this case, it seems to have worked out in the builder's favor.</p> <p>Claude 2</p> <p>This is a clever play on words that relies on a double meaning:</p> <p>Originally, the sign said &quot;Plots available here =&gt;&quot;</p> <p>When the 'L' blew off in the wind, it now read &quot;Pots available here =&gt;&quot;</p> <p>The word &quot;plots&quot; refers to plots of land that the builder was trying to sell for construction. But nobody was interested in buying them.</p> <p>However, &quot;pots&quot; can refer to pot, which is slang for marijuana. </p> <p>So when the sign changed from &quot;plots&quot; to &quot;pots&quot; after the 'L' fell off, people thought the builder was now selling marijuana instead of land. </p> <p>This drew in a lot more interested customers, since marijuana has much higher demand than empty land plots.</p> <p>So the builder inadvertently changed his advertisement from real estate to illegal drugs just by losing the letter 'L'! This gave his business a huge boost thanks to the double meaning play on words turning &quot;plots&quot; into &quot;pots&quot;. A clever if unintentional marketing ploy.</p> <p>Bing chat (powered by hatGPT 4)</p> <p>Hello, this is Bing. I can try to explain this joke for you. 😊</p> <p>The joke is based on a wordplay, where the letter L in the word &quot;plots&quot; is blown away by the wind, making it &quot;pots&quot;. The sign board then reads &quot;pots available here =&gt;&quot;, which attracts many people who are interested in buying pots. Pots are usually cheaper and more popular than plots, so the builder gets more customers after the change.</p> <p>The joke also implies that the builder is unaware of the change, and thinks that his land plots are suddenly in high demand. This creates a humorous contrast between his expectations and reality. The phrase &quot;by jov&quot; is an old-fashioned way of expressing surprise or excitement, which adds to the comic effect. 🤣</p> <p>I hope this helps you understand the joke better. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask me. I can also generate some creative content for you, such as poems, stories, code, essays, songs, celebrity parodies, and more. Just let me know what you want me to create. 🙌</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Over_Description5978"> /u/Over_Description5978 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17p6z1z/i_asked_a_simple_hard_joke_to_all_poppular_ai/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17p6z1z/i_asked_a_simple_hard_joke_to_all_poppular_ai/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: 这是一个关于寻找使用Johnny Cash的声音进行歌曲配音的问题，提供了歌词但不知道如何获取他的声音，已经尝试过的选项要么需要付费，要么没有Johnny Cash的选项。同时，还需要一种方法来叠加乐器伴奏。这是一个学校项目，非商业用途。 </div>

总结: 最近有人开始使用像GPT-3/4这样的AI工具来生成代码。这似乎可以快速生成代码并提高生产力。然而，我也担心直接复制和粘贴AI生成的代码而不经过适当的审查可能会导致错误、低效或不安全的代码。AI对正确性、优化、安全性等方面没有深入的理解。我认为AI代码生成工具需要谨慎和负责任地使用。代码在使用之前应该始终由人类进行审查，而不仅仅是盲目地复制和粘贴。AI可以辅助编码，但不应替代扎实的计算机科学技能。你们对使用AI进行编码辅助有什么看法？你们看到了主要的优点或缺点吗？我对尝试过这些AI工具的编码人员的观点很感兴趣。 </div>

The AI doesn't have a deep understanding of things like correctness, optimization, security, etc.</p> <p>I think AI code-generation tools need to be used carefully and responsibly. The code should always be reviewed by a human before using it, not just blindly copied and pasted. AI can assist in coding but it shouldn't replace solid computer science skills.</p> <p>What do you all think about using AI for coding assistance? Do you see major pros or cons? I'm interested in perspectives from coders who have tried these AI tools.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Beginning-Scholar105"> /u/Beginning-Scholar105 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17p6brr/thoughts_on_using_ai_like_gpt_for_coding/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17p6brr/thoughts_on_using_ai_like_gpt_for_coding/">[comments]</a></span>
