总结: 我们正在创造历史上最强大的受害者。这难道不是殖民主义的最终目标吗？我知道人们会看到这个问题，并因为认知偏见和个人感受而回答“不是”，但从我作为美国外的观察者来看，情况似乎有可能在这个领域出现可怕的转变。一些备受尊重的美国精英正在谈论奇点将如何毁灭我们，而世界其他地方只能袖手旁观。如果我们不阻止AI对此发表言论，你认为AI会对此有何看法？ </div>

总结: 这篇文章讨论了像ChatGPT这样的机器人是如何工作的。作者提出了一个问题，即如何使AI能够同时与大约100万人进行对话，并具有相同的智能。当AI在一般任务上变得和普通人一样出色时，就会有100万个数字工作者，他们可以同时处理任意数量的不同事物，只要这些工作可以通过计算机完成。这些工作者可以全天候工作，并且如果需要让他们同时在一个项目上工作，可以设置一个“虚假”的企业结构，其中包含所有的工作，从而像从无到有地创建创业公司，直到项目完成。这只是一个16岁瑞典人的随机思考。 </div>

And a thing i want to bring up is how the ai can be instanced so that Around 1 million people can talk to an AI of the same intelligence simultaneously. Ith many different topics and questions. Now imagine when that ai becomes as good as the average person for general tasks. Then you have 1000000 digital workers which can work on any amount of different things simultaneously just as good as the average human if the work can be done form a computer. That can work 24/7. An dif you want may of them to work on a single project at once you set up a ''fake'' Corporate structure with all the jobs therein basically making start ups form thin air untilt he pprject is completed.

More than less this is using LM Studio to let you run whatever LLM you want. You can run autogen to give it the task and abilities you want. Plus if you want to use multiple bots you can. And then you're using memgpt for long term memory. This letting it remember things and recall as needed instead of you having to constantly remind it.</p> <p>You can step this up by training your own LLM. The video doesn't get into this.</p> <p>This isn't a perfect solution, but I think it's the best we got at this point. </p> <p>&#x200b;</p> <p>I have a theory that it might be possible with memgpt basically you can have a AI that grows with you. Like you can switch out and update the LLM over time, and have it refer to memgpt to get all its former memories. And as the tech gets better it can in theory become your perfect personalized AI.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/crua9"> /u/crua9 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17ko74v/howto_run_your_own_ai_llm_for_free_locally/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17ko74v/howto_run_your_own_ai_llm_for_free_locally/">[comments]</a></span>

It addresses challenges in analyzing long-form videos and complex tasks like understanding storylines spanning multiple episodes.<br /> - It uses GPT-4V to transcribe multimodal elements into a detailed textual script, enabling advanced capabilities like audio description and character identification. </li> <li><strong>President Joe Biden signed an executive order for AI safety</strong><br /> - President Joe Biden has signed an executive order directing government agencies to develop safety guidelines for AI. The order aims to create new standards for AI safety and security, protect privacy, advance equity and civil rights, support workers, promote innovation, and ensure responsible government use of the technology.<br /> - It calls for the sharing of safety test results by developers of large AI models and urges Congress to pass data privacy regulations.</li> <li><strong>Microsoft’s new AI teaching tool in collab with teachers</strong><br /> - Microsoft Research has collaborated with teachers in India to develop an AI tool called Shiksha copilot, which aims to enhance teachers' abilities and empower students to learn more effectively. The tool uses generative AI to help teachers quickly create personalized learning experiences, design assignments, and create hands-on activities.<br /> - It also helps curate resources and provides a digital assistant centered around teachers' specific needs. The tool incorporates multimodal capabilities and supports multiple languages for a more inclusive educational experience.</li> <li><strong>Apple has released its new journaling app called Journal</strong><br /> - Journal focuses on multimedia content, such as photos and videos, and offers algorithmically curated writing prompts. Apple has expressed no plans to offer Journal on other platforms, despite its work on porting iOS apps to macOS. </li> <li><strong>Practica launched career coaching and mentorship AI chatbot</strong><br /> - Practica has launched an AI chatbot system for career coaching and mentorship. The AI chatbot acts as a personalized workplace mentor and coach, offering guidance on various topics such as management, strategy, sales, and more.<br /> - The AI coach uses a technique called Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to match the best learning resources for users and encourages them to read the content.</li> <li><strong>Alibaba upgrades its AI model and released industry-specific models</strong><br /> - Alibaba’s Tongyi Qianwen 2.0 now has &quot;hundreds of billions of&quot; parameters, making it one of the world's most powerful AI models. The company has also launched eight AI models for various industries, including entertainment, finance, healthcare, and legal sectors. Alibaba's industry-specific models provide dedicated tools for image creation, coding, financial data analysis, and legal document search.</li> <li><strong>NVIDIA’s engineers showcased how AI can help in designing semiconductor chips</strong><br /> - Nvidia's NeMo, a generative AI model, has been used by semiconductor engineers to assist in the complex process of designing chips. The model, called ChipNeMo, was trained on Nvidia's internal data and can generate and optimize software, as well as assist human designers. The team has developed use cases including a chatbot, a code generator, and an analysis tool. </li> <li><strong>MIT scientists developed an AI copilot system ‘Air-Guardian’ for flight safety</strong><br /> - The system works with airplane pilots, based on a deep learning system called Liquid Neural Networks (LNN), can detect when a human pilot overlooks a critical situation and intervene to prevent potential incidents.<br /> - Air-Guardian can take over in unpredictable situations or when the pilot is overwhelmed with information, highlighting critical information that may have been missed. The system uses eye-tracking technology and heatmaps to monitor human attention and evaluate whether the AI has identified an issue that requires immediate attention.</li> </ul> <p>More detailed breakdown of these news and innovations in the <a href="https://theaiedge.substack.com/p/microsoft-new-ai-joe-biden-apple-chatgpt-nvidia">daily newsletter</a>.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RohitAkki"> /u/RohitAkki </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17klx5f/twominute_daily_ai_update_date_10312023_news_from/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17klx5f/twominute_daily_ai_update_date_10312023_news_from/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: 这篇文章讨论了一个关于应用程序中使用AI比较用户提供的描述与预设参数的问题。作者希望能够在没有互联网连接的情况下，在应用程序中使用一个可以与游戏一起运行并通过本地网络IP使用API进行通信的工具。作者尝试了chat gpt 3.5，但由于其运行在OpenAI服务器上，所以不符合要求。 </div>

I have the following problem.</p> <p>I have an application (A mental development game) that has several arrays containing various properties for an object, such as:</p> <p>color [red, green, blue, yellow]</p> <p>shape [square, triangle, circle],</p> <p>outline color [red outline, blue outline]</p> <p>outline shape [dotted, solid, dashed]</p> <p>size [small, marge, medium]</p> <p>and many more...</p> <p>It loops through all the arrays and randomly picks out properties, then presents a shape to a user. The user then needs to type in the description of the object.</p> <p>What I'd like to do is have the AI compare if the user-provided description contains all parameters or if something is missing. Maybe output a 80% specifying how accurate the description was, based on how many correct parameters were included. The application knows wat parameters were used. Can even store all the parameters as a single string.</p> <p>What can I use to achieve this? Is it possible to make something that can run on the users computer without requiring internet connection and can be included with the game (Made using Godot Engine) perhaps something that launches alongside the game and communicated with each other using an api via local network ip?</p> <p>I experimented with chat gpt 3.5 and it gave flawless answers but... that's chat gpt for ya.
