KyberCloak is based on post-quantum lattice-based cryptography, which is considered to be one of the most promising approaches to cryptography in the age of quantum computing.</p> <p>KyberCloak is released under an MIT license, so anyone can use it for any purpose, including commercial use. I hope that KyberCloak will be widely adopted and help to protect our data from quantum attacks in the future.</p> <p>I also hope that KyberCloak will inspire more people to look into the challenge of developing quantum-resistant encryption algorithms. It is a very difficult task, but it is essential to ensure the security of our data in the future.</p> <p>If you are interested in learning more about KyberCloak including accessing the Github link to the code, please visit the project website at <a href="https://turingssolutions.com/f/introducing-kybercloak---a-new-way-to-keep-your-messages-private">https://turingssolutions.com/f/introducing-kybercloak---a-new-way-to-keep-your-messages-private</a>.</p> <p>**Why is quantum-resistant encryption important?**</p> <p>Quantum computers are expected to be able to break many of the encryption algorithms that are used today. This would have a devastating impact on our security, as it would allow attackers to access our sensitive data, such as financial information, personal communications, and government secrets.</p> <p>Quantum-resistant encryption algorithms are designed to be secure even against quantum attacks. This makes them essential for protecting our data in the future.</p> <p>**What is KyberCloak?**</p> <p>KyberCloak is a new encryption algorithm that is based on post-quantum lattice-based cryptography. Lattice-based cryptography is considered to be one of the most promising approaches to cryptography in the age of quantum computing.</p> <p>KyberCloak is very efficient and can be used to encrypt data of any size. It is also very flexible and can be used in a variety of applications, such as secure messaging, data storage, and network security.</p> <p>**How can I use KyberCloak?**</p> <p>To use KyberCloak, you will need to generate a public key and a private key. The public key can be shared with anyone, but the private key must be kept secret.</p> <p>To encrypt a message, you will need to use the public key of the recipient. To decrypt a message, you will need to use your private key.</p> <p>**Challenge to the community:**</p> <p>I hope that more people look into this challenge and try to develop new encryption algorithms that cannot be cracked by quantum computers. It is a very difficult challenge, but it is important one. The future of our security depends on it. This algorithm borrows ~85% from existing work and research in this area. My initial challenge I set for myself was to try and come up with something wholly new in this area. I could not do it. Lattice based frameworks are the only thing that are currently known to work. KyberCloak is a significant improvement on existing Lattice frameworks, Eventually, we will need something more. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Fantastic-Ninja3839"> /u/Fantastic-Ninja3839 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17elw4g/kybercloak_a_new_encryption_algorithm_to_resist/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17elw4g/kybercloak_a_new_encryption_algorithm_to_resist/">[comments]</a></span>

So being a SWE, I decided to build an AI enabled reading assistant for myself and for others that might need it.</p> <p><strong>Outtloud features:</strong></p> <ul> <li>100+ AI voices in over 10 accents</li> <li>Natural sounding human-like voices</li> <li>Focus mode - enhanced reading assistant</li> <li>Translation (adding soon)</li> <li>ChatGPT integration - Integrate ChatGPT into any document for query &amp; summarization (adding soon)</li> </ul> <p>I have read feedbacks from early users and seeing how this solution have been helping people with reading difficulties read better, makes me really happy and motivated. I plan on adding more and more features, making improvements based on feedbacks.</p> <p>People have also asked me how Outtloud differs from Speechify and others: </p> <p>I have actually built Outtloud as an inspiration from Speechify 🙌. It was a great TTS app and I have used my share of it. But I have come to realized that it is lacking some core features that could really make an actual change if implemented. </p> <p>I hope Outtloud will get to where Speechify is someday and maybe even further.</p> <p>Try it out for FREE and share your feedback: <a href="https://outtloud.com">Outtloud</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/herberz"> /u/herberz </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17dua9d/ai_voice_reader_for_those_who_reads_a_lot/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17dua9d/ai_voice_reader_for_those_who_reads_a_lot/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: 在电影和节目中，我多次看到这种情况，未来主义者要么是自私的混蛋，要么是邪恶的人，威胁他人（要么奴役他们，要么将他们变成机器人）。这可能是因为这些人讨厌自己或讨厌身边的真实人，只想拥有未来的科技。所以我想我们应该放弃未来的技术，关心朋友和家人，这样地球上就不会有更多贪婪、邪恶的混蛋了。 </div>

This has made her life very difficult and is very overwhelmed, she is also very sensitive and takes her work too seriously which makes it even more difficult for her to unwind.</p> <p>I have become increasingly worried as she has delayed her marriage too.</p> <p>Anyway I was looking into using the free chatgpt or bing gpt4 to offload her work or make it less painfully and overwhelming.</p> <p>Kindly answer my questions, would be profoundly grateful for any help guy.</p> <p>1 best prompts to ensure chatgpt or bing doesnot hallucinate so it gives summaries from exact text only</p> <p>2</p> <p>Gamify and fully customize topics based on individual kids favorite stories and characters which they can relate eg actual stories of batman spiderman and marvel etc</p> <p>3</p> <p>Bing DALLE3 only gives 25-30 creations, is there a way to get access to more for free if I prove it is for autistic kids education? We are outside USA though.</p> <p>4 </p> <p>Can the custom flash cards for each kid can be stored in a separate profile of Anki or similar app in my sister phone so she can at certain times engage with certain kids based on their specific custom learning material? There are around 30 children each with varying and individual learning needs.</p> <p>5</p> <p>Can chatgpt/bing also create sort of gamification or reward systems like those found in mobile games so the kids truly feel accomplished after each session?</p> <p>6 </p> <p>Free better alternate for doing this?</p> <p>I'm not very well verse in this just started looking into this very recently so specific prompts would be more appreciated which I will test, but honestly at this time any help would be so much appreciated.</p> <p>Thank you so much!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/aaatings"> /u/aaatings </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17dujp9/can_chatgpt_or_other_ai_do_this_for_autistic_kids/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17dujp9/can_chatgpt_or_other_ai_do_this_for_autistic_kids/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: 我是少数几个相信不久的将来，我们的生活、生活方式和日常活动将被人工智能有效改变的人之一。几年前，我甚至不知道什么是人工智能，也不知道它能做什么，突然之间，到处都是关于人工智能的新闻和进展。OpenAI，人工智能的教父，一直在不懈努力地将人工智能引入每个人的生活中，我想我们应该感谢Sam哈哈。人工智能的应用几乎无处不在。从教育到制造业、医疗保健、商业，基本上你转身都会有人工智能存在或正在整合人工智能。我认为我们正在进入一个新时代，我们都需要为其带来的影响做好准备。很多人对这些激进的变化和人工智能带来的一切都感到担忧。这一切都相对较新和可怕。很多人担心“人工智能末日”，害怕人工智能接管人类。也许有一天会发生，但现在更可怕的是它对经济的影响，因为越来越多的工作岗位被人工智能取代或将被取代，因为相对来说，人工智能是比人类更便宜、更快、更聪明的劳动力。无论如何，足够的抱怨/谈话/警醒了。你在采取什么措施来应对不可避免的人工智能进化？学习新技能？还是你只是随便应付？ </div>

总结: 作者是一个新手程序员，正在尝试使用palm2 api调用来解决简单的数学问题。由于有大约50,000个问题，作者正在寻找一个可以扩展的解决方案。作者知道LLMs并不适用于数学，但是他找不到任何可以理解数学问题、将其转化为数学方程并准确解决的工具。Gpt4在聊天格式中做得很好，但目前似乎有点昂贵。作者尝试了Bard聊天，它能够返回简单数学问题的解决方案（准确率为60%）。问题是当作者尝试使用palm2 api解决相同的问题时，准确率只有20%。作者的前提是：Bard基于相同的模型，虽然聊天可能会进行优化，但准确率不应该有这么大的差异。作者希望能得到关于自己可能出错的地方或者其他可以探索的方法的建议或想法。非常感谢！ </div>

Gpt4 does pretty good job on it at least in chat format but it seems bit costly as of now.
