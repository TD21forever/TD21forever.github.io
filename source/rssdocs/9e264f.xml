总结: 我是少数几个相信不久的将来，我们的生活、生活方式和日常活动将被人工智能有效改变的人之一。几年前，我甚至不知道什么是人工智能，也不知道它能做什么，突然之间，到处都是关于人工智能的新闻和进展。OpenAI，人工智能的教父，一直在不懈努力地将人工智能引入每个人的生活中，我想我们应该感谢Sam哈哈。人工智能的应用几乎无处不在。从教育到制造业、医疗保健、商业，基本上你转身都会有人工智能存在或正在整合人工智能。我认为我们正在进入一个新时代，我们都需要为其带来的影响做好准备。很多人对这些激进的变化和人工智能带来的一切都感到担忧。这一切都相对较新和可怕。很多人担心“人工智能末日”，害怕人工智能接管人类。也许有一天会发生，但现在更可怕的是它对经济的影响，因为越来越多的工作岗位被人工智能取代或将被取代，因为相对来说，人工智能是比人类更便宜、更快、更聪明的劳动力。无论如何，足够的抱怨/谈话/警醒了。你在采取什么措施来应对不可避免的人工智能进化？学习新技能？还是你只是随便应付？ </div>

From education, to manufacturing, healthcare, business, basically everywhere you turn to has AI in it or in the process of integrating AI.</p> <p>I think we are entering a new era and we all need to brace for the impact.</p> <p>A lot of people are concerned about these radical changes and all that AI brings. It’s all relatively new and scary. A lot are scared about the “AI armageddon”, afraid of AI taking over humanity. </p> <p>Maybe someday, but right now, I think what’s more scaring is the effect it is about to have on the economy, as more and more jobs are being overtaken or will be overtaken by AI as it is relatively cheaper, faster, smarter labor than human.</p> <p>Anyways, enough rant/talk/wake up call.

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Yes, I am aware MemGPT exists. MemGPT is exactly why I am releasing Kadane's Sliding Window under an MIT Open-Source license. MemGPT only works with OpenAI. If you do not want to pay OpenAI money, you cannot use it. Kadane's Sliding Window is about 15 lines of Python code. You can slap this baby into whatever LLM model you would like to! </p> <p>I personally tested it out with a Phi-1.5 model. Works nice. Wrote me a nice and very long story about Alice in Wonderland. It stayed congruent with the story the entire time, because it had a context window that I fed it, that grew and grew as it spit out the story. It took about 10 seconds to set it up. </p> <p>Release Date: October 20, 2023</p> <p>License: MIT Open-Source</p> <p>Introduction</p> <p>Kadane's Sliding Window is a new long-term memory window for large language models (LLMs). It is adjustable to any length, depending on the size of the model and the limitations of the hardware. Kadane's Sliding Window is specifically designed to be used with any LLM model, and it is very simple to add to any existing model architecture.</p> <p>Motivation</p> <p>Kadane's algorithm has existed in computer science for a long time. Kadane's algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm for finding the maximum subarray of a given array. It is also particularly well-suited for tasks that involve finding patterns in sequences. It has one limitation; it is meant for unlimited arrays, but I want it for limited strings. So, 'Kadane's Sliding Window'. Ez Pz lemon squeezy.</p> <p>LLMs are powerful tools for generating text, translating languages, and answering questions in an informative way. However, they have one major limitation: they have a very short memory. This means that they can only remember the information that is contained in the context that they are given.Kadane's Sliding Window addresses this limitation by providing LLMs with a long-term memory window. This window allows LLMs to store and access information from the past, even if it is not explicitly included in the context that they are currently given.</p> <p>Implementation</p> <p>Kadane's Sliding Window is implemented as a queue. The queue is initialized with a maximum length, which is determined by the size of the model and the limitations of the hardware. As the model generates text, the tokens are added to the queue. When the queue reaches its maximum length, the oldest tokens are removed.</p> <p>To use Kadane's Sliding Window, simply add the following code to your existing LLM model architecture:</p> <p>Python</p> <p>class KadaneSlidingWindow:</p> <p>def __init__(self, maxlen):</p> <p>self.maxlen = maxlen</p> <p>self.window = collections.deque()</p> <p>def add(self, elements):</p> <p>for element in elements:</p> <p>self.window.append(element)</p> <p>if len(self.window) &gt; self.maxlen:</p> <p>self.window.popleft()</p> <p>def get_context(self):</p> <p>return &quot; &quot;.join(self.window)</p> <p># Create a Kadane Sliding Window with a maximum length of 1000 tokens</p> <p>kadane_sliding_window = KadaneSlidingWindow(maxlen=1000)</p> <p># Add the context to the sliding window</p> <p>kadane_sliding_window.add(context.split())</p> <p># Generate text using the LLM model</p> <p>output_ids = model.generate(input_ids=input_ids)</p> <p># Decode the generated text using the tokenizer</p> <p>generated_text = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)</p> <p># Add the generated text to the sliding window</p> <p>kadane_sliding_window.add(generated_text.split())</p> <p>Benefits</p> <p>Kadane's Sliding Window offers a number of benefits for LLMs, including:</p> <p>Improved performance on tasks that require long-term memory, such as question answering and summarization.</p> <p>Increased creativity and diversity in generated text.</p> <p>Reduced need for human intervention, as the model can learn to perform tasks without being explicitly told what to do.</p> <p>Conclusion</p> <p>Kadane's Sliding Window is a powerful new tool for improving the performance of LLMs. It is simple to implement and can be used with any LLM model architecture. Kadane's Sliding Window is released under an MIT Open-Source License, so anyone can use it to improve their own LLMs.</p> <p><a href="https://turingssolutions.com/f/kadanes-sliding-window-unlimited-memory-for-any-llm-model">Release Article Contains GitHub Link</a></p> <p>Here is almost my full code from playing around with it:</p> <p>import collections</p> <p>import torch</p> <p>from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer</p> <p>class KadaneSlidingWindow:</p> <p>def __init__(self, maxlen):</p> <p>self.maxlen = maxlen</p> <p>self.window = collections.deque()</p> <p>self.long_term_memory = []</p> <p>def add(self, elements):</p> <p>for element in elements:</p> <p>self.window.append(element)</p> <p>self.long_term_memory.append(element)</p> <p>if len(self.window) &gt; self.maxlen:</p> <p>self.window.popleft()</p> <p>def get_context(self):</p> <p>return &quot; &quot;.join(self.window)</p> <p># Create a Kadane Sliding Window with a size of 1000 tokens</p> <p>kadane_sliding_window = KadaneSlidingWindow(maxlen=1000)</p> <p># Initialize the Phi-1.5 model</p> <p>model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(&quot;microsoft/phi-1_5&quot;, trust_remote_code=True, torch_dtype=&quot;auto&quot;)</p> <p>tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(&quot;microsoft/phi-1_5&quot;, trust_remote_code=True, torch_dtype=&quot;auto&quot;)</p> <p># Generate text with the Phi-1.5 model and the Kadane Sliding Window</p> <p>prompt = &quot;Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Alice who lived in a small village.

On the other hand, it poses a significant threat to publishers who depend on click-throughs for revenue and look for essential recognition.</p> <p><strong>The dilemma here is stark:</strong> allow Google to summarize your content and risk losing recognition and traffic, or opt-out and lose visibility on the web almost completely! It's like being caught between a rock and a hard place.</p> <p>So, what can publishers do to protect their interests? Here are some strategies from my understanding:</p> <p>- Optimize for Snippets - If Google is going to summarize your content, make sure it's your best content displayed and your references get included in the summaries. Use SEO strategies to optimize for featured snippets and summaries and make the most of this chance!</p> <p>- Diversify Revenue Streams - Don't put all your eggs in the Google basket. Explore other revenue-generating avenues like subscriptions, sponsored content, and merchandise.</p> <p>- Engage Directly with Your Audience - Use social media and newsletters to build a loyal community. Direct engagement can help you create an alternative route to reach your audience.</p> <p>- Collaborate and Advocate - Team up with other publishers to advocate for fair practices. There's strength in numbers.</p> <p>Having a progressive mindset to evolve with changes while striving for an equitable middle ground often the best way ahead in the dynamic digital era, but how can this be implemented by publishers in your opinion? </p> <p>Is this actually an SEO opportunity in disguise for those who can create the most helpful and summarizable content?</p> <p>Let's discuss!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/vikas_agrawal77"> /u/vikas_agrawal77 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17cyacd/googles_ai_summary_feature_has_publishers_in_a/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17cyacd/googles_ai_summary_feature_has_publishers_in_a/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: AI安全峰会将于下个月举行，但其中存在一些问题。我有两个关注点，似乎都涉及将AI赋予神一般的力量，这似乎更像是对AI经济的宣传，而不是真正令人担忧的即将到来的AI问题。末日肯定不是其中之一。《大西洋月刊》发表了一篇非常好的文章，指出那些在AI经济中有所收益的领导人正在使他们的产品看起来比实际能力更强大。在这种情况下，他们正在夸大AI的能力，我同意这种夸大。比尔·盖茨和山姆·阿尔特曼签署的声明是什么，让《大西洋月刊》写了这篇文章？看一下。这是一个荒谬的声明，有无数个理由可以反驳。首先，他们是在看《黑客帝国》之类的电影吗？要发生这样的事情，AI必须几乎具有感知能力，但它没有。它必须被无差别地整合，但它没有。而且它不仅不是这些东西，甚至在那种程度上也没有被梦想过。我们更关注的是这种AI应用是否会对数据或某个种族群体产生偏见。你可以提出一些社会伤害、不公平优势、访问和自动化过程的问题，这些问题开始被整合，但也许不应该被整合。此外，你还可以谈谈对就业和人类就业的潜在影响。后者是我最关注的问题，也是应该讨论最多的问题。就是这样。如果你认为现在有什么神级通用AI，那一定是个笑话。现在开箱即用的准确性和可用性非常有限。在AI时代，我们的水平相当于一粒精子进入输卵管。它甚至还没有到达卵子。我们甚至还没有意识到我们正处于“有了家庭”的状态。这样夸大其词的说法真是可笑。《大西洋月刊》正是这样指出的。对此的反应是正确的。 </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For context, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/oct/20/rishi-sunak-global-ai-safety-summit-connor-leahy#:%7E:text=Warnings%20such%20as%20this%20prompted,person%20for%20the%20first%20time">AI safety summit</a> is slated for next month. But something about it smells. There are 2 concerns I have about this. Both seemingly go to a point of assigning god like AI powers that seemingly act as an advert to the economy of AI rather than any real concerning imminent AI concerns. Doomsday sure the hell isn't one of them.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/06/ai-regulation-sam-altman-bill-gates/674278/">The Atlantic</a> (<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/ai-doomerism-is-a-decoy/ar-AA1c37C5">full article here</a>) wrote a really good article assigning this idea that by leaders who stand to gain in the economy of AI are making their product seem so grandiose that one would walk away thinking AI is more capable than it is. In this case, it is making it seem AI is very over exaggerated; in this, I agree it's being very over exaggerated.</p> <p>What's the statement, signed by Bill Gates and Sam Altman, that got the Atlantic to write this article? Check it out.</p> <blockquote> <p>“mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.”</p> </blockquote> <p>Huh? What the hell? This is a ridiculous statement for a million reasons. Preposterous. Unwarranted. First off, were they watching a screening of the Matrix or something. In order, for something like this to happen, AI would have to be damn near sentient and it's not. It would have to be integrated indiscriminately and it's not. And not only is in not any of these things but it isn't even being dreamed about in that capacity.</p> <p>We're more on the level of is this AI application going to have bias towards data and or a certain racial group. You can throw in some social harms, unfair advantages things, access and automated processes that are beginning to be integrated but perhaps shouldn't be. As well, you can also talk about the potential impact to jobs and human employment going forward. The latter is the most concerning issue to me and the one that should be the most discussed. That's pretty much it.</p> <p>That's pretty much it folks, if you're thinking god level general AI that has to be a joke right now. Nobody can be serious when they're saying that.</p> <p>Why? The level of accuracy and usability of what is out of the box right now is so very limited. In terms of where we are in the era of AI is the equivalent of a male sperm entering into a fallopian tube. It hasn't even reached the egg yet. We haven't even realized we are, as my mother would put it, &quot;in a family way.&quot; It's just laughable to make such grandiose admissions.</p> <p>The Atlantic makes exactly this point. The reaction to it is on point to call out the ridiculous signed statement by the AI community.</p> <blockquote> <p>“This seems like really sophisticated PR from a company that is going full speed ahead with building the very technology that their team is flagging as risks to humanity,” Albert Fox Cahn, the executive director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project </p> <p>The unstated assumption underlying the “extinction” fear is that AI is destined to become terrifyingly capable, turning these companies’ work into a kind of eschatology. “It makes the product seem more powerful,” Emily Bender, a computational linguist at the University of Washington, told me, “so powerful it might eliminate humanity.” That assumption provides a tacit advertisement: The CEOs, like demigods, are wielding a technology as transformative as fire, electricity, nuclear fission, or a pandemic-inducing virus. You’d be a fool not to invest. It’s also a posture that aims to inoculate them from criticism, copying the crisis communications of tobacco companies, oil magnates, and Facebook before: Hey, don’t get mad at us; we begged them to regulate our product.. </p> <p>Yet the supposed AI apocalypse remains science fiction. “A fantastical, adrenalizing ghost story is being used to hijack attention around what is the problem that regulation needs to solve,” Meredith Whittaker, a co-founder of the AI Now Institute and the president of Signal</p> </blockquote> <p>Wow, that's a pretty clear and damning set of statements from people in the industry but are they valid points?</p> <p>I argue yes, very much so.</p> <p>The products that are out right now are so limited. I recently wrote a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17cpk0i/llm_vs_traditional_model_building_vs_model/">Reddit post</a> about how Microsoft C-suite is convincing other companies C-suites' so much to believe that general AI is so here and now that everything should just be shoved into LLM's right now - it just works. An negative effect is that I can't even get data to create models to help build stability and efficiency of the LLM processes. It's downright bizarre. Again, why? Because the tech isn't that great. It's amazing it truly is but it has so many limitations. It hallucinates, it's very inconsistent with data, it's horrible at obvious math.</p> <p>It takes so much support and surrounding of hand holding components such as multiple data parsing steps, chunking data, data annotation and embedding processes to just get it into some usable and plausibly usable state.</p> <p>No, hallucinations aren't usefully wrong but rather they're actually detrimental.</p> <p>Let's talk about the hallucinations so it isn't just some phrase that has a mystery behind what it actually means.</p> <p>As of now there are multiple forms of the LLM's getting things wrong. For example, if you say to the LLM I want you to read over this text and tell me a number of things you read and make sure to include all of these parts in your reply it will sometimes do it and many times just not do it. You go back and prompt fix and in many cases you prompt fix as much as you can (spending hours sometimes) and it still doesn't work properly. There are ways to solve around this but that is for another day. In short it usually involves more data procurement and adding more and more to the pipelining.</p> <p>Then, there is the form of hallucination that everyone is most familiar with - flat out getting things wrong/lying. There is no way at scale to know if such a thing is happening. In theory, you could deploy an application and it could just be giving your customers completely inaccurate information. You know, like that Nuke button (ridiculous/sarcasm.) The kicker is, you would have no idea that it is happening.</p> <p>Everything is so blackboxed in terms of metrics and thresholds of correctness you really don't have good insight as to what is going on while you're not watching. Again, there are ways to code and solve around these issues. But it's work and careful planning.</p> <p>This is very different than NLP style bot applications that are way more traceable and predictable towards efficiency and accuracy. I know what is going on so there is trust in that. Confidence if you will. The ability to release that product into the public and know it will work.</p> <p>My point here is that this technology is amazing but it's also riddled with inaccuracies and inadequacies.</p> <p>Now, go back above and re-read the doomsday statements made by big tech and perhaps you can see my point about how insane it is to sound such ridiculous alarms.</p> <p>Does anyone believe the military is about to let the nuke button be handled by GPT 4 and just set it and forget it? Hell no, it's laughable as I said before. Ask yourself, if the military isn't about to let this sort of AI be integrated indiscriminately into their systems why the hell would we A. think of doomsday scenarios right now and B. would you let it run your business indiscriminately? No, you wouldn't right?</p> <p>So what's the AI summit that is coming up in November by the British Prime Minister. To me, it seems like the second half of this weird pushing AI by assigning scariness to it. Hype by FEAR if you will. Italy even banned GPT in the country. Just a ridiculous overreaction. There is no need for this summit. Is Britain even a player that needs to call a summit about AI that is being developed in the US. No offense but I'm confused as to why a British prime minister is worried about what is being developed by a US company. Has this ever been done before? I can't remember in my lifetime something like this ever happening. Italy's stance seems to be 'not in my house,' but what does Britain hope to gain from this summit?</p> <p>Something about the British meeting smells even. I'm not saying people in Britain or any other country in the field for that matter shouldn't have such a meeting but is it on a political/governmental level at this point? What are you planning on regulating here.</p> <p>To me this is the paradox of bullshit that big tech is playing with right now. This is god level so watch out - but don't overly regulate us as we are just getting started.</p> <p>The truth is this technology needs about 10 additional years of incubating before anything as serious as a governmental level scrutiny should be worrying about in terms of AI and where it may or maynot go. AI was considered dead 12 months ago, and now all of the sudden, we're in the Matrix-like scenario about to wipe out humanity /s.</p> <p>Institutions have too much data work, data integration, data annotation and fixing of legacy systems to even begin to make meaningful impacts in the AI space. Yes, cloud companies will make a hell of a lot of money before the companies using their services will have time to figure out how to properly use and make valuable returns on their AI investments. We are in that period now figuring out how to use it and dealing with all of it's inadequacies not nuclear doomsday scenarios.</p> <p>&#x200b;</p> <p>&#x200b;</p> <p>&#x200b;</p> <p>&#x200b;</p> <p>&#x200b;</p> <p>&#x200b;</p> <p>&#x200b;</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Xtianus21"> /u/Xtianus21 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17ddumf/what_is_expected_to_gain_from_an_ai_safety_summit/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17ddumf/what_is_expected_to_gain_from_an_ai_safety_summit/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: 在人工智能领域，LLM/GAI/RAAI等技术备受瞩目，但从作者的角度来看，这种技术并不能完全满足企业的需求。尽管LLM在构建认知自动化应用方面非常强大，但企业仍应该根据自身的知识产权和企业级数据开发自己的模型。作者认为，传统模型构建与LLM的结合是有必要的，通过将精确预测或结果添加到LLM请求中，可以更好地满足企业的需求。 </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Here is the background. At my job the past couple of months we have pivoted to all things LLM/GAI/RAAI. My background is in AI and cognitive automation. The hype in our world is beyond reproach. It gives me pause in certain aspects. Some (hell most) of the hype is coming directly from the big 3 cloud vendors. </p> <p>Here is the rub. It seems to be that behind the scenes from the top down (execs) it is being said that LLM's are the end-all of anything and everything one needs for their artificial intelligence needs. </p> <p>As an exec and engineer (I still write my own code and models) I can unequivocally say this is bullshit. LLM's are great but they don't know your proprietary data. They can't. In fact, if all your corporate enterprise data is already inside of GPT I can surmise you don't have a very innovative platform. If your secret sauce is already in the LLM that should be a concern for you. </p> <p>Don't get me wrong, ChatGPT and LLM's are amazing and I have made a living from building cognitive automation applications. So I get the power and strength of LLM's. However, the ability to develop your own model based on your IP/enterprise level data is something you should still be doing. </p> <p>However, the obvious synergy that could come from custom model building coinciding with your LLM pipeline is not happening. I'll get into this more later. </p> <p>What is happening is this, the business and low code fanatics which are always on the business side want to will into existence that custom models are not the way to go and just use LLM for everything and anything. This infuriates me. </p> <p>Some of the attitude is justified and I know where it comes from. Years of data scientists over promising and under delivering. Models that are just worthless in some respects.</p> <p>Here's how I see it. Why can't there be both working together. In one of the most memorable and best episodes of &quot;House of Lies&quot;, the awkward Doug Guggenheim is in the spotlight, prepping for a TED talk. While his colleagues anticipate a comedic disaster, but he surprises everyone. Drawing inspiration from Dungeons &amp; Dragons, he eloquently discusses orcs and the untapped strength in collaboration. This unconventional wisdom resonates deeply, especially with a profoundly high Marty Kaan, leading him to a groundbreaking idea: the fledgling marijuana industry could greatly benefit from partnering with big tobacco.</p> <p>Why can't we have this with AI/ML in a traditional model building sense coinciding with LLM's? From my work with LLM's I see the obvious need for this. Give me a model that might be fine tuned, delivers a decision tree or random forest result from proprietary data that can then be fed into the LLM's 0 / some shot formality. </p> <p>We have done this in POC's and pilots and it works so well. You do something that results in a precise prediction or result and then you add that into your prompt and LLM request. This results in less hallucinations and more of a consistent result from the LLM. </p> <p>Why aren't we working with the Orcs instead of saying that it should only be this one way. Am I wrong? I don't think so but I'd like to see what others think. If it is a good approach how can it be communicated that this approach is necessary. </p> <p>Why am I ranting about this. Because as we ask for more data we to build custom models there is pushback and the business approach of just shove this into the LLM see it works sometimes and GPT knows this. lol huh? where did you get that information about that one single case? imagine scaling that. You can't be serious. I digress. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Xtianus21"> /u/Xtianus21 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17cpk0i/llm_vs_traditional_model_building_vs_model/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17cpk0i/llm_vs_traditional_model_building_vs_model/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: Speech Condenser是一个用于简化和总结视频对话的项目。它通过提取视频中的音频，识别不同的发言人，将音频分割成小块，将每个块转录成文本，并将转录结果与发言人识别结果结合起来，为每个发言人提供基于文本的对话。最后，对话被总结以提供快速概览。整个过程是容器化的，确保无缝高效的操作。 </div>

It's designed to simplify and summarize dialogues from videos. Here's how it works:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Audio Extraction:</strong> First, it pulls out the audio from the video.</li> <li><strong>Speaker Diarization:</strong> It then identifies the different speakers in the audio.</li> <li><strong>Split Audio:</strong> Based on the identified speakers, the audio is divided into smaller chunks.</li> <li><strong>Speech to Text:</strong> Each chunk is then transcribed.</li> <li><strong>Combine ASR and Diarization:</strong> The transcriptions are combined with the diarization results, providing a text-based dialogue for each identified speaker.</li> <li><strong>Summarization:</strong> Finally, the dialogue is summarized for a quick overview.</li> </ol> <p>The entire process is containerized, ensuring a seamless and efficient operation.
