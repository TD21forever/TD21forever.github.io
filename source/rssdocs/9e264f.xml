                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Continuing with the exercise of sharing an easily digestible and smaller version of the main updates of the day in the world of AI. </p> <ul> <li><strong>SAP’s new AI tool for Developers</strong><br /> - SAP introducing SAP Build Code, an application development solution that incorporates gen AI to streamline coding, testing, and managing Java and JavaScript application life cycles.<br /> - This new offering includes pre-built integrations, APIs, and connectors, as well as guided templates and best practices to accelerate development. It enables collaboration between developers and business experts, allowing for faster innovation. </li> <li><strong>Cohere released Embed v3, latest &amp; most advanced text embedding model</strong><br /> - It offers top-notch performance in matching queries to document topics and assessing content quality. Embed v3 can rank high-quality documents, making it useful for noisy datasets. The model also includes a compression-aware training method, reducing costs for running vector databases. Developers can use Embed v3 to improve search applications and retrievals for RAG systems.</li> <li><strong>Luma AI’s Genie generates everything in 3D from only text</strong><br /> - Genie is powered by a deep neural network that has been trained on a large dataset of 3D shapes, textures, and scenes. It can learn the relationships between words and 3D objects and generate novel shapes that are consistent with the input.</li> <li><strong>Midjourney introduced a new feature ‘Style-tuner’</strong><br /> - For easier and more unified image generation, users can select from a variety of styles and obtain a code to apply to all their works, keeping them in the same aesthetic family. This is particularly beneficial for enterprises and brands working on group creative projects. To use the style tuner, users simply type &quot;/tune&quot; followed by their prompt in the Midjourney Discord server.</li> <li><strong>Runway released an update to its Gen-2 model with incredible AI video capabilities</strong><br /> - The update includes major improvements to the fidelity and consistency of video results. Gen-2 allows users to generate new 4-sec videos from text prompts or add motion to uploaded images. The update also introduces &quot;Director Mode,&quot; which allows users to control the camera movement in their AI-generated videos.</li> <li><strong>Microsoft’s new survey on business value and opportunity of AI</strong><br /> - The study surveyed over 2k business leaders and decision makers and found that 71% of companies are already using AI.<br /> - It also revealed that AI deployments typically take 12 months or less and organizations are seeing a return on their AI investments within 14 months.<br /> - For every $1 invested in AI, companies are realizing an average return of $3.5X.<br /> - However, a lack of skilled workers remains a major barrier to implementing and scaling AI. </li> <li><strong>Google AI’s new approach for adaptive LLM prompting</strong><br /> - Researchers proposed a method called Consistency-Based Self-Adaptive Prompting (COSP) to select and constructs pseudo-demonstrations for LLMs using unlabeled samples and the models' own predictions, closing the performance gap between zero-shot and few-shot setups.<br /> - The researchers also extended this idea to a wide range of natural language understanding and generation tasks with Universal Self-Adaptive Prompting (USP).</li> <li><strong>Brave privacy-focused browser has introduced new AI Leo</strong><br /> - Which claims to offer unparalleled privacy compared to other chatbot services like Bing and ChatGPT. Leo can translate, answer questions, summarize webpages, and generate content. A premium version called Leo Premium is also available for $15 per month, offering access to different AI language models and additional features.</li> </ul> <p>More detailed breakdown of these news and innovations in the <a href="https://theaiedge.substack.com/p/sap-aitool-developers-lumaai-midjourney-runway">daily newsletter</a>.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RohitAkki"> /u/RohitAkki </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17mxpac/twominute_daily_ai_update_date_11032023_news_from/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17mxpac/twominute_daily_ai_update_date_11032023_news_from/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: EnfinBref.io/en是一个小型网站，可以自动生成YouTube视频的摘要和要点。它可以按照片段和段落的方式生成摘要，并提取出3-6个要点作为执行摘要。未来还计划提供更多类型的摘要，并改进语音转文本功能。该项目使用了Firebase、FastAPI和React等技术，并结合了Mistral-7B和GPTs进行AI/ML处理。用户可以通过付费获得更多功能和无限制的摘要。 </div>

Currently, we arbitrarily define sections to be 45mn splits, and segments to be 5 minutes if the video is &gt;25mn, or 3mn if shorter.</li> <li>Extract a short list (3-6) of bullet points from the video, to serve as an executive summary sort of thing.</li> </ul> <p>&#x200b;</p> <p>Got a lot more things on the roadmap, as it's turned out to be an extremely fun project, namely:</p> <ul> <li>Stop relying on YouTube's auto-transcript and also do direct speech-2-text</li> <li>Provide better &amp; different types of summaries, depending on the detected content type, rather than the one-size-fits all right now.</li> <li>Automatically ID segment timestamps, providing chaptering, and no longer just using 5mn segments.</li> </ul> <p>&#x200b;</p> <p>This has mostly been a fun side project to continue working with LLMs that has actually grown decently (at a fairly small scale) popular. The underlying aspects are basically:</p> <ul> <li>Tech <ul> <li>Firebase for auth</li> <li>FastAPI python backend</li> <li>React front-end</li> </ul></li> <li>AI/ML <ul> <li>A blend of Mistral-7B and the GPTs (3.5&amp;4) for different tasks, whenever appropriate (fun fact: some videos randomly have a summary generated by a mix of a fine-tuned Mistral-7B and GPT, try to spot the differences!)</li> <li>Post-processing of the transcript using the more lightweight llm we use, because some of them are really unusable raw.</li> <li>A lot of branching logic as to what prompt is sent to what LLM to generate the final summaries shown to the users.</li> <li>Self-consistency checks to try and avoid things going too off rails: a lot of the LLM outputs are fed to another query to review the proposed summaries, alter them and try and make sure there are no hallucinations going on.</li> </ul></li> </ul> <p>EDIT: I forgot to meet the pricing disclosure requirements! The pricing model is a rate limit for un-logged in users, a (much, much greater) rate limit for logged-in users, and virtually unlimited summaries for premium users, at $7.5/month to support the inference cost mostly. The key points feature is logged-in users, and limited to 5-10 (dynamically set depending on inference costs again) a day/unlimited for premium users.</p> <p>&#x200b;</p> <p>Very happy to answer any questions/take on any feedback/discuss anything!</p> <p>&#x200b;</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Khalen"> /u/Khalen </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17myxdv/i_built_enfinbrefio_a_small_website_to_generate/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17myxdv/i_built_enfinbrefio_a_small_website_to_generate/">[comments]</a></span>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Here’s my latest blog, It’s based of a recent, Interesting research paper by Yang et al </p> <p>Personality detection involves identifying an individual's personality traits purely from their written text. This capability has many potential applications, like improving human-computer interaction. However, traditional machine learning models struggle to capture the nuances required for accurate personality detection from texts.</p> <p>Researchers from Sun Yat-sen University propose a new method called PsyCoT that takes inspiration from psychological questionnaires to significantly boost the performance of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 for zero-shot personality detection.</p> <p><strong>The PsyCoT Approach:</strong> PsyCoT treats personality detection as a multi-step reasoning task, similar to a person completing a personality questionnaire. It has the LLM take on the role of an AI assistant specializing in text analysis.</p> <p>Over multiple dialogue turns, the assistant is prompted to rate relevant questionnaire items based on the input text, with access to previous ratings. After rating all items, the assistant makes an overall personality judgment. This mimics the human process of reasoning through a questionnaire to evaluate someone's personality. The items act as an effective chain-of-thought, enhancing the LLM's capability for nuanced personality inference.</p> <p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong> PsyCoT prompts the LLM to rate questionnaire items in a multi-turn dialogue, mimicking how humans complete personality tests. This acts as an effective chain-of-thought.</p> <p>Experiments use two personality taxonomies - Big Five and MBTI. PsyCoT improves performance over standard prompting by 4.23 and 10.63 average F1 points respectively.</p> <p>On the Essays dataset, PsyCoT achieves better results than standard prompting on 4 out of 5 Big Five traits, even outperforming fine-tuned BERT and RoBERTa on some.</p> <p>Ablations show the multi-turn dialogue structure is important for consistency and accuracy compared to single-turn rating of all items together.</p> <p>PsyCoT exhibits greater robustness to input variations like changed option order compared to other prompting methods.</p> <p>The questionnaire used significantly impacts performance, so selecting the right one to cover relevant traits is crucial.</p> <p>Overall, PsyCoT provides an effective way to incorporate rigorous human reasoning processes into LLMs for improved complex judgment capabilities.</p> <p><strong>Looking Ahead:</strong> By incorporating the rigorous reasoning process of questionnaires, PsyCoT unlocks stronger personality detection abilities in LLMs without any training. It provides a promising new prompting technique for complex human judgments.</p> <p>Future work can explore PsyCoT's effectiveness for different LLMs, languages, and questionnaires. Overall, it offers an exciting way to elicit nuanced reasoning from the knowledge and capabilities of LLMs.</p> <p>Full credit to Yang, Tao, Tianyuan Shi, Fanqi Wan, Xiaojun Quan, Qifan Wang, Bingzhe Wu, and Jiaxiang Wu. &quot;PsyCoT: Psychological Questionnaire as Powerful Chain-of-Thought for Personality Detection.&quot; arXiv preprint arXiv:2310.20256 (2023).</p> <p>If you found this remotely interesting feel free to <a href="https://httos://www.thepromptindex.com/newsletter.html">join our weekly newsletter</a></p> <p>Full blog: <a href="https://www.thepromptindex.com/psycot:-a-window-into-the-future-of-ai-that-can-perceive-our-personalities-and-moods.html">The Prompt Index</a></p> <p>The paper is available on arXiv at this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20256">link</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/steves1189"> /u/steves1189 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17mgsxd/psycot_a_window_into_the_future_of_ai_that_can/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17mgsxd/psycot_a_window_into_the_future_of_ai_that_can/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: 随着ChatGPT的普及使用，出现了一些奇怪的情况。招聘经理使用AI来创建职位发布和总结筛选简历。求职者使用AI来制作完美的简历和求职信。结果，求职者的AI与公司的AI实质上是相互关联的。这意味着我们将不再直接与对方互动，而是始终通过LLM作为中介吗？现在，我们的生活是否取决于接触最高质量的LLM？拥有更好的LLM的人最终会拥有更好的约会应用程序配置文件和简历，因此在职业和感情方面比那些拥有较差LLM的人更成功？ </div>

Hiring managers use AI to create job postings and summarize and filter resumes for hiring. Job applicants are using AI to craft the perfect resume and cover letter.

We use AI to message each other.</p> <p>&#x200b;</p> <p>What is the implication of this? Does this mean we just won't directly interact with each other but always go through the intermediary of an LLM? </p> <p>Does access to the highest quality LLM govern our mileage in life now? The guy with a better LLM ends up with a better dating app profile and resume and therefore gets a better job and has more success romantically than the dude with the shittier LLM?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Legitimate_Ebb3623"> /u/Legitimate_Ebb3623 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17m9zdb/what_are_the_implications_of_ai_talking_to_ai/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17m9zdb/what_are_the_implications_of_ai_talking_to_ai/">[comments]</a></span>
