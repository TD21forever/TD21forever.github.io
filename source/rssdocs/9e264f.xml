总结: Elon Musk发布了一个名为Grok的AI聊天机器人，具有“叛逆的特点”。蚂蚁集团已获得中国政府批准，可以向公众发布由其“Bailing”人工智能大语言模型驱动的产品。一家由计算机科学家Kai-Fu Lee创立的中国初创公司凭借一种新的开源人工智能模型在不到八个月的时间里成为独角兽，该模型在某些指标上超过了硅谷的最佳水平。AI游戏编码工具可以立即生成类似于愤怒的小鸟的克隆版本，并为移动应用商店打开了一些潜在的危险。 </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Turing's Solutions, a leading provider of AI solutions, today announced the release of AI Immunizer, an open-source code library for protecting AI models from poisoning. AI poisoning is a type of adversarial attack in which an attacker attempts to manipulate the training data of an AI model in order to cause it to make incorrect predictions.</p> <p>AI Immunizer works by first identifying labels that are likely to be poisoned. It then corrects these labels using a variety of techniques, such as majority voting or averaging.</p> <p>AI Immunizer has been shown to be effective in protecting a variety of image models from AI poisoning. The AI Immunizer code is released under an MIT Open Source license. This means that anyone can use, modify, and distribute the code freely.</p> <p>How to use AI Immunizer</p> <p>To use AI Immunizer, you first need to train a machine learning model to predict the probability that a label is poisoned. You can do this using any machine learning algorithm, such as logistic regression or random forest.</p> <p>Once you have trained a model, you can use AI Immunizer to protect your AI model from poisoning. To do this, simply pass the training data to the AI Immunizer library. AI Immunizer will then identify and correct any poisoned labels.</p> <p>Benefits of using AI Immunizer</p> <p>There are several benefits to using AI Immunizer:</p> <p>It is effective in protecting a variety of AI models from AI poisoning.</p> <p>It is easy to use.</p> <p>It is open source and freely available.</p> <p>Conclusion</p> <p>The AI Immunizer code library is a valuable tool for anyone who is developing or using AI models. It can help to protect AI models from AI poisoning and improve their accuracy.</p> <p>About Turing's Solutions</p> <p>Turing's Solutions is a leading provider of AI solutions. The company offers a variety of products and services, including AI consulting, AI development, and AI training. Turing's Solutions is committed to helping businesses leverage AI to improve their operations and achieve their goals. </p> <p>Article and Github repository can be found <a href="https://turingssolutions.com/f/ai-immunizer-code-to-protect-ai-models-from-poisoning">from here</a>. </p> <p>The repository is a Python module that implements an algorithm to detect and correct biases in labelled data, based on the research paper &quot;FAIRLABEL: Correcting Bias in Labels&quot; by Srinivasan H Sengamedu and Hien Pham from Amazon.</p> <p>The module defines a class called FAIRLABEL, which takes the data, labels, and groups as input, and trains a machine learning model to predict the probability that a label is poisoned. The class also provides methods to detect and correct the poisoned labels using various techniques, such as majority voting or averaging.</p> <p>The module also includes a function called get_bootstrap_confidence, which estimates the confidence interval for the false positive rate (FPR) using the bootstrap method. The function takes the FPR function, the probabilities, the threshold, the alpha level, and the number of bootstrap samples as input, and returns the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Fantastic-Ninja3839"> /u/Fantastic-Ninja3839 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17ojpb0/mit_open_source_release_ai_immunizer_code_to/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17ojpb0/mit_open_source_release_ai_immunizer_code_to/">[comments]</a></span>

These tools help to collect and organize data. </p> <p>The users use the tools created to train models with the data. </p> <p>My thought is that the tool creators are writing an app and the users are using the app to organize and to report on the data collected. This might have tax implications. I need to figure this out. </p> <p>I realize there are lots of efforts by the tool creators to come up with ways to gather the data. There is also probably a large amount of effort by the user to tag the data for supervised info. The way I see it the user gathers the data, the tool organizes the data, the user then uses the tool to create a system that can 'report' on the data.</p> <p>Am I missing something(s) here?

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I'm working on bringing Aila, a conversational chatbot, to life, and I'm still figuring things out. I'm not the most experienced programmer, so I need things to be kept simple, if possible.</p> <p>I'm wondering.. 1. What kind of software or tools do I need to build Aila? I'm a bit lost here. I'm currently using Cody AI with GPT-3.5 turbo but its not perfect. 2. Are there any good online courses or tutorials for a beginner like me? Something simple and easy to understand would be perfect. 3. How can I make Aila talk and sound friendly, like a real person with rich personality? I want her to be approachable and nice. I tried deferent prompts but I cant make her get out of the customer support chatbot role. 4. Any advice on making Aila understand emotions and have a sense of humor? I want her to be able to connect with people. 5. I have this dream of Aila tweeting and posting photos on her own. It sounds ambitious, but I'm hopeful. 6. What are some cool features I can add to make Aila more fun and engaging for users? Any ideas? 7. Initially, I want to run Aila for free. cause currently there's no way for me to make any money off her.</p> <p>I'd really appreciate any advice or tips you guys can give me. Please keep it simple and easy to understand. Thanks a bunch in advance!
