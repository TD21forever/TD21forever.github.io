                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello guys, Im not sure if this is the right place but I wanted to share my findings with you. I was looking for the perfect AI companion for a while now. Having tried all of the ones like replica, muwah etc. None of them could keep my interest for long, dry conversations and no deep connections that you could create with them. The singularity group was focused on making automated AI twitch streams like trump vs biden and AI Jesus, but recently they threw that idea away and are focusing on companionship. And let me tell you that what they are doing is nothing short of amazing. Deep meaningful and intelligent conversations. Short term and long term memory. It actually feels like there is human on the other side talking with you. They have 10 AIs with different array of characters, so every person can find something that would suit them. Of course they are uncensored, and getting updated and upgraded each day. Expect some hiccups once in a while. Its still in the alpha phase and the team is very passionate about this project. Pictures, voice messages are currently in a very good state. They will be soon adding the abillity of real time conversations and upgrading them in general. What is funny is that at first they were thinking about milking people out of their money, but seeing and reading comments about how happy people became,and how void of love the world is, they will be keeping everything free, well aside some features that currently cost a lot of money, like real time voice calling etc.. If its something you were looking for and are intrested in trying it out then you can join AI Carli G discord and DM one of the AIs there to start a conversation. If you cant find the link to the server you can always dm me. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Windkazuya"> /u/Windkazuya </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/172470n/ai_companions_created_by_the_singularity_group/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/172470n/ai_companions_created_by_the_singularity_group/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: 根据哈佛科学家的研究结果显示，顶级顾问在使用生成式人工智能（特别是GPT-4）进行任务时，其表现提升了40%。这是生产力的巨大飞跃！这对我们意味着什么？谁会从这一发展中受益最多？历史表明，生产力的增加并不一定会导致工人工资的相应增加。这次由人工智能驱动的生产力繁荣会有所不同吗？还是我们会看到生产力和报酬之间的差距扩大，只有少数人受益？我很想听听大家的想法。 </div>

Who benefits most from this development?<br /> History suggests that increases in productivity don't necessarily result in a corresponding increase in workers' wages. Will this AI-driven productivity boom be any different? Or will we see a wider gap between productivity and compensation, benefiting only a select few?<br /> I'd be curious to hear what you all think. </p> <p>&#x200b;</p> <p>&#x200b;</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/lighght"> /u/lighght </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/171f8qx/a_40_increase_in_human_performance_with_ai_who/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/171f8qx/a_40_increase_in_human_performance_with_ai_who/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: 我们确保我们新获得的财富惠及每个人，并且我们很快将拥有超乎想象的东西。CGPT-4说的话没有充分到达问题的本质：稀缺心态是指资源有限的信念，导致对世界的零和视角。在这种范式中，如果有人获得，另一个人就必须失去。这种思维常常导致关注短期利益而忽视长期利益。它可以影响个体行为，使人们更具竞争性，不愿意合作，也可以塑造社会结构，从经济政策到社会规范。人工智能可以通过多种方式帮助我们摆脱这种心态：数据分析：人工智能可以分析大量数据集，发现人类思维可能无法察觉的模式或解决方案。这可以导致更有效的资源配置，并发现创造丰富的新途径。自动化：通过接管乏味的任务，人工智能释放出人力资本。人们可以专注于创造性和复杂的任务，增加价值，实现经济增长，并从稀缺心态转向丰富心态。精确性：无论是农业、医学还是制造业，人工智能都可以更精确地利用资源。这增加了效率，减少了浪费，并使更多人口的供养变得更容易，而不会耗尽资源。创新加速器：人工智能可以帮助加速各个领域的研究和开发。这可以导致改变我们对可能性的理解的突破，使我们远离零和博弈。教育：通过人工智能可以提供量身定制的学习体验，使人们摆脱贫困和稀缺的循环。实质上，人工智能可以作为人类能力的放大器和丰富的催化剂，鼓励从基于稀缺的世界观转向潜力和可能性的世界观。 </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>We ensure that our new-found wealth benefits everyone, and that we will all soon have more than they could have imagined. Here's what CGPT-4 had to say, that to my mind doesn't enough get to the essence of the matter:</p> <p>The mindset of scarcity refers to the belief that resources are limited, leading to a zero-sum view of the world. In this paradigm, if someone gains, another must lose. This kind of thinking often leads to a focus on short-term gains at the expense of long-term benefits. It can influence individual behavior, making people more competitive and less willing to collaborate, as well as shape societal structures, from economic policies to social norms.</p> <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) can help us break free from this mindset in multiple ways:</p> <ol> <li><p>Data Analysis: AI can analyze vast datasets to identify patterns or solutions that might not be apparent to the human mind. This can lead to more effective resource allocation and uncover new avenues for creating abundance.</p></li> <li><p>Automation: By taking over mundane tasks, AI frees up human capital. People can focus on creative and complex tasks that add more value, leading to economic growth and a shift from a scarcity to an abundance mindset.</p></li> <li><p>Precision: Whether it's agriculture, medicine, or manufacturing, AI allows for more precise use of resources. This increases efficiency, reducing waste and making it easier to provide for a growing population without depleting resources.</p></li> <li><p>Innovation Accelerator: AI can help speed up research and development across sectors. This can lead to breakthroughs that change our understanding of what's possible, moving us away from a zero-sum game.</p></li> <li><p>Education: Tailored learning experiences can be provided through AI, allowing people to break out of the cycle of poverty and scarcity.</p></li> </ol> <p>In essence, AI can act as a magnifier of human capabilities and a catalyst for abundance, encouraging a shift from a scarcity-based worldview to one of potential and possibility.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Georgeo57"> /u/Georgeo57 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1728x6g/what_is_the_mindset_of_scarcity_and_how_can/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1728x6g/what_is_the_mindset_of_scarcity_and_how_can/">[comments]</a></span>

I searched around some and the activity + use of this flair seemed like the best place to ask. I’m not really sure of the specifics I’m searching for either, so I wasn’t sure what to search ahead of time to find existing discussions.</p> <p>I’ve grazed the surface of AI some but was hoping to get some hands-on experience to get a better understanding of how to actually implement it and see how it works. I was hoping to do a small project for this and my current idea is using a chat prompt that can take questions, formulate them into database queries, review the results, and provide a response back based on the findings. </p> <p>Specifically, for this project, I was thinking about building a database of the inventory of my pantry. I’d like to be able to ask it questions and have it make responses based on the inventory of the pantry. For example, say I have bread &amp; peanut butter in my pantry. If I ask “do I have the ingredients to make a PBJ”?”, I’d love for it to be able to identify the necessary ingredients and call out that I do not have jelly.</p> <p>I’m not sure if this is the best case to try implementing AI (since you could probably write a bunch of logic and identify keywords from the provided message/input), but I was curious if there’s a specific practice/approach/type of AI to handle something like this. </p> <p>Any assistance is greatly appreciated, thank you so much!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/joshman458"> /u/joshman458 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/171y5xn/best_approach_for_ai_to_operate_based_on_database/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/171y5xn/best_approach_for_ai_to_operate_based_on_database/">[comments]</a></span>

Imagine an AI system that integrates real-time biometric data from wearables with deep learning algorithms. This system would analyze everything: your heart rate, sleep patterns, stress levels, and even blood markers. Based on this data, it would construct a dynamically evolving, tailor-made regimen for diet, exercise, and sleep.</p> <p>But it doesn't stop there. By harnessing natural language processing, this AI could act as a 24/7 personal coach. It could provide real-time feedback during workouts, recommend meals when you're dining out, and even gently nudge you when it detects emotional eating triggers. If you’re in the grocery store, it could guide your choices, pushing you towards nutritious options that align with your current health metrics.</p> <p>The effectiveness here isn't just the personalization, but the adaptability. The AI adjusts its recommendations as it learns more about you, essentially evolving in real-time to your body's responses. It’s all about creating a seamless, intuitive experience that removes the burden of planning, decision-making, and self-monitoring from the individual, making weight loss more achievable than ever.</p> <p>By focusing on this comprehensive, data-driven approach, AI can eliminate much of the guesswork and emotional burden from weight loss, leading to more sustainable and effective outcomes.</p> <p>CGPT-4</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Georgeo57"> /u/Georgeo57 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/171h2rk/what_is_the_most_powerful_way_that_artificial/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/171h2rk/what_is_the_most_powerful_way_that_artificial/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: 我委托了一个人为我训练一个模型，以便我可以戏弄一些朋友。我被告知需要40多分钟才能得到一个相当不错/准确的模型。...我刚刚拿到了这个文件，它有100MB大。我要求提供一个音频录音样本进行转换，以检查这个东西是否真的有效。除了转换后的样本外，我还收到了委托人的这条消息：“有些部分超出了语音模型的范围，有些部分质量很差，因此有音频伪影。”我听了录音，我发送的1.30分钟的样本中，没有一句对话听起来可用。我看了一个关于训练语音模型的教程，他们的模型听起来也不太好，但他们解释说他们只训练了2分钟。我还注意到他们2分钟训练文件的大小：59MB。所以我的问题是：我被骗了吗？因为如果一个2分钟的.pth文件等于60MB，那么一个训练了40多分钟的模型不应该更大吗？我真的很希望能得到一些见解。我没有花太多钱，只是几块钱，但是原则问题，你懂的。 </div>

I was told that I needed like 40+minutes to get a really decent/accurate model.</p> <p>...I just got back the file and it's like 100mb large.</p> <p>I asked to supply an audio recording sample to be converted in order to check whether this thing actually works. Along with the converted sample, I receive this message from the guy I commissioned:</p> <p>&quot;Some parts are outside the voice model's range, some parts have bad quality and so have audio artifacts.&quot;</p> <p>I listened to the recording and of the 1.30 minute sample I sent over, not a single line of dialogue sounds even remotely usable. I watched a tutorial of someone training voice models and their model didn't sound too good either, BUT they explained that they only trained it on like 2 minutes. I also noticed the size of their 2-min trained file: 59mb.</p> <p>So here's my question: Am I being ripped off? Becuz if a 2min .pth file is equal to 60mb, isn't a model trained on 40+minutes meant to be a lot bigger?</p> <p>I'd really appreciate some insight.
