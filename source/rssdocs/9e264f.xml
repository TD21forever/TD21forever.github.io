<br>
<br>
总结: 我的组织对GPT存在担忧，但在我看来，我们处理得相当好。人们需要记住，基本上有两种GPT，即Open AI版本和Azure版本。Azure版本具有企业保护措施，这意味着他们可能会同意“不会”使用您的任何数据。我不确定Open AI是否有同样的协议。 </div>
                        <hr>
                    
                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My organization had this fear and still does but managed it pretty well in my opinion. People need to remember there is basically 2 GPTs. The open ai version and the azure version. The Azure version has enterprise protections meaning it may be agreed upon they &quot;won't&quot; use any of your data. I'm not sure if Open AI has the same agreement.</p> <p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/02/samsung-bans-use-of-ai-like-chatgpt-for-staff-after-misuse-of-chatbot.html">This cnbc article</a> </p> <p>What's weird is why these companies (Samsung and JP Morgan) have this agreement. They're multi-billion dollar companies. </p> <p>We had weeks of debate and forethought about this when GPT first came out. We got a version that is agreed that we don't need to worry about it. Code pilot is a, similar thing. Literally they wouldn't be able to sell it otherwise. </p> <p>What I suspect is that they're referring to not these &quot;versions&quot; of gpt but rather the online openai version. From there, yeah, it's free game. </p> <p>Whats hillarious though this tells me 2 things and Samsung is most surprising here. </p> <ol> <li><p>How the hell doesn't Samsung and JP Morgan have these special versions? Cheep much? I mean I'd hope to God Samsung is forward thinking enough to be using it. They're a tech company for goodness sakes. JP Morgan has a much more plausible worry here. </p></li> <li><p>Jesus how much are you monitoring your workers? Did I read that right? Employees putting sensitive code from their personal computers on GPT? Lol what? I assuming they mean work computers. Who says personal computers referring to work computer. My work laptop for instance. </p></li> </ol> <p>Lastly, and this is the main point. Who cares? There is no stopping this. An LLM doesn't work in that way. It takes, information and eats it into words and associations. It's doing that with billions of other samples. </p> <p>In other words, you can't say tell me what Jane doe did for her thesis on 1993 and then it just prints it out. It doesnt work that way. Yeah, collectively we're all making it better and thus smarter but it's not that deterministic. </p> <p>Think of the internet. If you could down load all of the internet into your brain do you think you give a care about what one random thing is? No you woukd retrieve things colectively and parse out what you think is important. </p> <p>Even art is similar here. Who cares it can produce art? If I buy a painting I'm going to buy a humans painting. I'm sure there will be AI paintings but I'm not in need of that. And if the artist I like uses AI in parts of their work good for them. I wouldn't care if someone used a tool to make their Art better as much as I'd care that someone uses digital editing tools to make their blue blur and light filter via photoshop. </p> <p>I don't. I'm buying the artists art. The person is my interest and what that person created. </p> <p>What do these CEO's think, the AI isn't going to get their data so it won't know about your thing. Lol yeah right. If you think that way you're going to get left behind. </p> <p>You won't accept it enough to learn how to use it. Embrace it. Learn from it. Master it. The flood fates are open and the damn has broke. There is no information worth hiding. In fact, I'd argue the quicker we do it the faster we're get to further advancements and capabilities derived from AI. </p> <p>It's enevitable. </p> <p>I put my oseronal code in, just parts, all the time. I'm not creating a new programming language for goodness sakes. It's not going to steal and isolate your code. It's just going to borrow it. </p> <p>Does anybody have a counter argument.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Xtianus21"> /u/Xtianus21 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17i7pwx/is_it_laughable_when_companies_worry_about_data/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17i7pwx/is_it_laughable_when_companies_worry_about_data/">[comments]</a></span>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all! Firstly a huge thanks in advance to anyone who spends time responding to this. </p> <p>So I’m working on my MVP which I’m about to launch (in its simplest form this is an AI based news aggregator) </p> <p>To date my server set up has been: </p> <ol> <li><p>data storage, scraping, and app API calls to my digital ocean server. This is a 2GB memory, 1 AMD vCPU 50 GB disk server running LAMP on Ubuntu 20.04</p></li> <li><p>All my AI LLM work where I preprocess and clean text, locally run LLMs from hugging face is done through a Scaleway PLAY2-PICO instance. </p></li> </ol> <p>A few issues I’m facing:</p> <ol> <li><p>The api calls to the digital ocean server are incredibly slow. Takes 5 seconds to load posts and I’m the only one using the app. </p></li> <li><p>The scaleway server processes for LLMs just get killed I assume due to memory issues or whatever it is. </p></li> </ol> <p>So now to the question. What is the server architecture / providers you guys use? It needs to be able to deal with large data tables in MYSQL quickly as well as run large LLM models as well (the two don’t need to be the same set up) </p> <p>Much appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/thewanitz"> /u/thewanitz </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17i8twn/server_set_up/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17i8twn/server_set_up/">[comments]</a></span>

How long before AI stories will be created into real movies. AI music and AI simulated pop stars, once again the music and imagery will be so realistic, the charts will be just robots competing with new 'bands' and singers and the music itself will be better than anything any human has written because of algorithms which ensure they keep improving and improving and get better and better.

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi fellow AI enthusiasts! </p> <p>As someone relatively new to the world of AI, I recently started exploring ways to connect AI apps and automation. During my research, I stumbled upon a blog post that features 8 AI applications and provides info on how to integrate them with Make.com, which is my go-to automation service. </p> <p>I thought I'd share this resource with you, especially for those who, like me, are at the early stages of their AI adventure. The blog post introduces a list of these AI apps and gives a brief overview of what each one does: </p> <ul> <li><strong>Pinecone,</strong></li> <li><strong>Synthesia,</strong></li> <li><strong>Leap AI,</strong></li> <li><strong>Mem,</strong></li> <li><strong>Chatbase,</strong></li> <li><strong>Hugging Face,</strong></li> <li><strong>ElevelLabs,</strong></li> <li><strong>OpenAI: Whisper.</strong></li> </ul> <p>&#x200b;</p> <p>At the same time, you also learn about Make.com <strong>templates that feature these apps</strong>. I personally find them helpful because they are pre-configured and guide you through the setup. Here are some of the tasks these templates can assist with: </p> <ul> <li><strong>Extracting data from Google Sheets and linking it with Pinecone</strong> <ul> <li>Potential use case: keep track of product availability and stock levels in your online store. </li> </ul></li> <li><strong>Fetching new records from Airtable and training Leap AI by using the collected data.</strong> <ul> <li> Potential use case: automatically collect and analyze data from (e.g.) customer survey submissions.</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>Creating Mems from fresh Pipedrive CRM deal data.</strong> <ul> <li>Potential use case: assess the status of various sales opportunities.</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>Condensing Slack message threads and producing Mems from the collected information.</strong> <ul> <li>Potential use case: compile key takeaways and action items from extensive Slack conversations.</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>Crafting voiceovers from WordPress articles and connecting them to a Google Sheet.</strong> <ul> <li> Potential use case: make blog posts and articles available in audio format.</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>Transcribing Zoom recordings through OpenAI's Whisper, summarizing them, generating audio files with ElevenLabs, and sharing them via Slack.</strong> <ul> <li> Potential use case: Transcribe discussions, summarize important points, and share audio highlights with team members.</li> </ul></li> </ul> <p>&#x200b;</p> <p>I found the post really interesting and thought it might spark your interest as well. </p> <p><strong>Link to original resource:</strong> <a href="https://www.make.com/en/blog/how-to-scale-ai">https://www.make.com/en/blog/how-to-scale-ai</a></p> <p>&#x200b;</p> <p>&#x200b;</p> <p>&#x200b;</p> <p>&#x200b;</p> <p>&#x200b;</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TheOppoziteOfBatman"> /u/TheOppoziteOfBatman </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17hmyt2/ai_apps_and_automation_interesting_blog_post/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17hmyt2/ai_apps_and_automation_interesting_blog_post/">[comments]</a></span>
