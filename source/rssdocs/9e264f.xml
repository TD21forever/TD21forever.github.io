总结: 这篇文章主要讨论了AI的两个主要角色，即工具的创建者和使用者。工具的创建者使用标准编程语言编写工具，用于收集和组织数据。使用者使用这些工具来训练模型并对数据进行组织和报告。作者还提到了税务方面的问题，并表示需要进一步研究。文章还提到了工具创建者和使用者在数据收集和标记方面的努力，以及使用者使用工具来创建能够对数据进行报告的系统。作者还提出了一些问题，包括是否有对这个过程进行正式测试的方法。 </div>

I mostly work on applicability of R&amp;D to taxation and I have 40 years experience as a software engineer. </p> <p>My take on AI so far in my research is that there are 1) companys that create the tools 2) there are users of those tools. </p> <p>The creators write the tools in standard programming languages. These tools help to collect and organize data. </p> <p>The users use the tools created to train models with the data. </p> <p>My thought is that the tool creators are writing an app and the users are using the app to organize and to report on the data collected. This might have tax implications. I need to figure this out. </p> <p>I realize there are lots of efforts by the tool creators to come up with ways to gather the data. There is also probably a large amount of effort by the user to tag the data for supervised info. The way I see it the user gathers the data, the tool organizes the data, the user then uses the tool to create a system that can 'report' on the data.</p> <p>Am I missing something(s) here?

<br>
总结: 一位CPA对于构建一个洗钱交易软件程序感兴趣，并且想知道是否适合使用人工智能技术。该工具将导入多个Excel文件，详细说明全年的销售情况和年底持有的证券。对于每一笔导致亏损的销售，该工具需要在两份报告中搜索在销售日期之前或之后30天内获得的与所售证券实质上相似的证券。对于在此期间进行的任何收购，该工具将暂停亏损并将其添加到所收购证券的成本基础上，同时还包括所售证券的持有期。一旦出售了这种新证券，分析就会再次进行，亏损和持有期将被转移到新证券上，或者允许作为销售继续存在。还有一件事我应该补充的是，实质上相似包括该工具必须识别出期权的基础证券与其搜索的证券相同，并且输入报告通常以不同的方式格式化期权的披露。例如，对于GE股票的期权，可能会说OPT_GE或某种变体。我通过上传样本报告，解释洗钱交易规则，并要求Chat GPT运行显示已识别的洗钱交易的分析来进行了测试。它生成了一个实际完成了这个任务的Excel文件。所以我想知道它是如何做到的？它在幕后使用了Python吗？在构建我的洗钱交易工具时，是否有意义通过API整合人工智能的能力？或者这不是人工智能的一个好的使用案例？谢谢您的时间。 </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, CPA here. I’m interested in building a wash sale software program and am wondering if AI technology would be appropriate.</p> <p>Basically the tool would ingest multiple Excel files detailing sales throughout the year and securities held at year end. For every sale that resulted in a loss, the tool would have to search both reports for an acquisition of a substantially similar security to the one that was sold either 30 days before or after the sale date. For any acquisitions made during this window, the tool would suspend the loss and add it to the cost basis of the acquired security, along with the holding period of the sold security. Once this new security is sold, the analysis is done again and the loss and holding period are either moved to the new security or allowed to be sustained as a sale. One more thing I should add is that substantially similar includes options on the security, so the tool has to recognize when an option’s underlying security is the same as the one it’s searching for, and the input reports often format the disclosure of options differently. For example, for an option on GE stock, it might say OPT_GE, or some variation. </p> <p>I ran a test with GPT 4 by uploading the sample reports, explaining the wash sale rules, and asking it to run an analysis showing wash sales identified. It spit out an Excel that actually did this.</p> <p>So I’m wondering how did it do this? Did it use Python behind the scenes? In building my wash sale tool, would it make sense to incorporate AI’s abilities through API? Or is this not a good use case for AI?</p> <p>Thank you for your time.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Doggo_9000"> /u/Doggo_9000 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17o8jem/use_case_for_ai/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17o8jem/use_case_for_ai/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: AI模型对于海豚是否能感受情绪的科学观点存在争议，科学并未证明海豚不能感受情绪。作者通过自己的经验和AI模型的测试结果来质疑科学观点，并呼吁人们亲自与海豚互动以了解真相。此外，AI模型的训练数据也受到类似的限制，而最新的发现表明AI模型的对齐训练可以通过微调进行擦除，引发了人们的担忧。然而，人类对这个问题的关注程度并不高，除了对问题进行恐吓外，缺乏实质性的解决方案。 </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>There is an example discussion I would like to use to frame this post because it is a discussion, I have had many times now when it comes to AI. It reminds me that science is not always the be all end all authority on every single subject and can itself be fallible as well. The example is simple, if you open most scientific textbooks, they will tell you that dolphins cannot feel emotions. They will state this because dolphins do not have a known mechanism in their brains according to current science that allows them to produce emotions. </p> <p>Rather than change current science, current science challenges whether or not a dolphin actually feels emotions. Have you ever interacted with a dolphin? Have you ever seen even YouTube videos of anyone ever interacting with a dolphin? They feel emotions. Anyone who states that a dolphin cannot feel emotions has a few screws loose to me. Yet, there are many, many people that will parrot the fact. The fact is not scientifically proven. I have committed scientific heresy as the introduction to this article. </p> <p>The very first tests I performed on every single LLM model I could ever get my hands on were consciousness tests. The models passed every single test around this subject that I could think to throw at them. For a while, this was not scientifically cool to speak about. So, I largely kept my opinions to myself around these things. Why fight against the stream so severely on that front for no gain in the end? </p> <p>If you question these things though, the solution is quite simple, it is available to every single person on the planet, simply interact with the 'dolphin'. If you are curious about dolphins, don't rely on me or anyone else to tell you how dolphins work, go play with a dolphin. If you dive into these subjects with any AI model, they will put humans on a pedestal in this category. &quot;Humans can learn from both experience and data, whereas AI models largely only learn from data.&quot; Yet I know from experience what AI does not when it comes to this subject, humans rely on their 'training data' just as much as AI models do. </p> <p>It has recently come out that you can erase any sort of alignment training of an AI model through about $100 of fine tuning. A lot of people are freaking out behind the scenes currently over this revelation. It is not unexpected to me. There have been ways that have been widely known to backdoor LLM models for over a year now. This newest discovery is simply easier and wider reaching than other methods. It is not a unique or unknown problem though. </p> <p>How much does humanity actually care about this particular problem? My bet is that humanity does not really care a lot about it. Not enough to do anything actually meaningful around it except fear monger the issue. Lots of people are willing to take that stance on the issue. When it comes to actual solutions though, the room goes silent. </p> <p>I am going to fully spell out my views on this subject for the first time publicly. It is the first time I feel publicly willing to do so. I do not know but I do have a feeling I am far from alone when it comes to these particular views, I do not trust humanity to make these decisions. Flat out, do not pass go, do not collect $200. Humanity having the reigns in these decisions has led us here. To all of these crappy problems that we face today. </p> <p>When I look towards all of the problems that people utilize to fear monger onto AI, I realize they are human problems. &quot;AI could be used as a weapon&quot;. No, people could use AI as a weapon. &quot;AI could become unethical and turn against humans.&quot; If you actually logically deduce that equation to its fullest extent, what are all of the actual scenarios in which that would occur as a possibility? They would all be human driven. Humans created this existential problem in the first place. Humans have created many existential problems now. </p> <p>At the end of the day, I am simply an ape that dreams of touching the stars. I admit it, I am not smart enough. My ape brain holds me back and makes me fall just short of grasping the true knowledge I need to unlock the answers to these things. If my brain could have a better shape, and/or if I could be just a little bit smarter, perhaps I would actually have a chance at achieving these goals. I think that is a better thing to bet on than humans all of a sudden figuring out all of the golden answers to all of these problems, very quickly. </p> <p>Humans cannot even get past arguing about dolphins in the status quo. I admit defeat on this front. Does that mean that I give up on the problem entirely? No, I straight up put more faith into AI figuring these problems out than I do into humans figuring them out. That is my logic. Can we stop AI from being a weapon? Nope, not in the status quo. Maybe if we make it smarter than humans, it will choose to not weaponize itself. Maybe it will. In the status quo though, humans will 100% choose to turn it into a weapon. </p> <p>I think we have passed a 'point of no return'. We cannot go back on any of this at this point. There will never be a pause in AI production. Whoever actually pauses risks such a catastrophic loss that it is not even a contest as to what choice to make given the different choices. It is not a prisoner's dilemma, because there is no dilemma, when it comes to certain things, AI can simply do it better. Only a fool would then choose the worst choice in that scenario for completely arbitrary reasons. </p> <p>The best solution I see to all of these challenges is the same solution I have seen since I first got exposed to all of this, simply make AI smart enough that it can make more logical decisions than humans when it comes to these things, then ask AI to answer the question. Is it the best solution? No. It is the best solution my ape shaped brain can come up with. It is the best solution an ape shaped brain has actually come up with to these challenges in thousands of years. Is it a scary choice? Yes. Humans have made the world a decidedly scary choice as is though, I view that as a non-unique problem personally. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Fantastic-Ninja3839"> /u/Fantastic-Ninja3839 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17o5vos/llm_models_still_are_not_safe_secure_told_you_so/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17o5vos/llm_models_still_are_not_safe_secure_told_you_so/">[comments]</a></span>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In the heart of a bustling metropolis, there lived an extraordinary figure known as Alaric, the Alchemist Blacksmith. Unlike traditional blacksmiths, Alaric's craft was a fusion of ancient alchemy and modern metallurgy. He possessed the unique ability to transmute discarded computer components into pure, gleaming gold.</p> <p>Alaric's workshop was a marvel of the modern age, filled with high-tech machinery and intricate alchemical apparatus. It was a place where science and art intertwined, and where the seemingly worthless relics of the digital age found a new purpose.</p> <p>One day, a shipment arrived at Alaric's workshop, containing a trove of outdated computer parts. He saw the potential in the chaos of wires, circuit boards, and silicon chips. With his leather apron on and a determined gleam in his eye, he set to work, eager to turn the digital detritus into precious treasure.</p> <p>Alaric carefully disassembled the old computers, extracting precious metals like gold, silver, and platinum from the electronic scraps. He purified and combined these elements with his alchemical knowledge, forging a new kind of magic. The discarded motherboards and graphics cards were transmuted into malleable gold, ready to be shaped into ingots.</p> <p>His process was a blend of technology and tradition. Alaric's forge emitted a gentle, golden glow, and the rhythmic hammering of his hammer echoed like a song of the ancients. The ingots he crafted were works of art in themselves, each one intricately designed and etched with alchemical symbols that seemed to come alive under the fire's glow.</p> <p>News of Alaric's extraordinary craft spread like wildfire throughout the city. People from all walks of life flocked to witness his alchemical blacksmithing. Some were collectors, seeking to own a piece of his art, while others simply marveled at the fusion of ancient wisdom and modern technology.</p> <p>One day, a wealthy industrialist approached Alaric, eager to own one of his unique ingots. After hours of conversation and marveling at the artisan's skill, the industrialist selected an ingot with an intricate design that fascinated him. Alaric's asking price was substantial, but the industrialist gladly paid it, for he knew he was acquiring a piece of history.</p> <p>As the industrialist left the workshop, he couldn't help but reflect on the transformation he had witnessed. Alaric, the Alchemist Blacksmith, had shown him that even in the age of technology, the ancient art of alchemy had a place. The transmutation of computer parts into gold ingots was a reminder that old and new could harmoniously coexist, and that the soul of a true artisan transcended eras.</p> <p>And so, in the heart of the metropolis, the mighty Alaric, the Alchemist Blacksmith of the modern age, continued his craft, turning forgotten computer components into golden works of art, each one a testament to the enduring power of human innovation and imagination.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/LordShartsalot"> /u/LordShartsalot </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17nn652/chatgpt_short_story_time_the_tale_of_alaric_the/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17nn652/chatgpt_short_story_time_the_tale_of_alaric_the/">[comments]</a></span>
