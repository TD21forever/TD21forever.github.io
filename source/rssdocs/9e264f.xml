                <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello! I would like to share my tool <a href="https://easyvid.xyz/">EasyVid</a>. EasyVid generates full videos from a simple text prompt! EasyVid adds voiceovers, subtitles, music, and background visuals automatically. All you need to do is enter a script and EasyVid does the rest :)</p> <p><strong>What is EasyVid?</strong></p> <p>EasyVid started as an experiment to see if I could use AI to automatically generate Youtube videos. After a weekend of coding, I created an automated Youtube channel. A few months ago I posted some of my videos to Reddit and I got a bunch of requests for the tool. So I decided to develop it further and make it publicly available!</p> <p><strong>Who am I?</strong></p> <p>I'm the solo developer for EasyVid. It's a side project and it's been very exciting building everything myself. I have learned a lot so far and the journey is just getting started :)</p> <p><strong>How to use EasyVid</strong></p> <p>I wanted to make it as easy as possible to make videos (hence the name), so it's just 3 steps:</p> <ol> <li>Type or paste in your script</li> <li>Adjust any settings (voice, language, aspect ratio, etc.)</li> <li>Click &quot;Generate video&quot;</li> </ol> <p>A few minutes later, you'll get a full video (.mp4 file) with an AI voiceover, automatic subtitles, AI-generated background visuals, and music!</p> <p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p> <p>- <strong>Voiceover:</strong> A narrator reads out your script with a very realistic, humanlike voice. I'm using Elevenlabs for text-to-speech and it's been really good! They seem to have the best audio quality by far compared to any other competitors at the moment.</p> <p>- <strong>Subtitles:</strong> These are automatically generated from the script and lined up with the audio. No AI here really but many people ask about this step. </p> <p>- <strong>Background Visuals:</strong> This tool generates background images using Stable Diffusion, an AI image generator. The images are custom prompted to match the content of the script. This makes it useful for creative video styles like stories and poems. I am really looking forward to DALLE-3 however and will likely switch once they make the API available!</p> <p>After everything is generated, it all gets stitched together and saved to a .mp4 file, ready to download!</p> <p><strong>Free to try</strong></p> <p>Everyone gets 40 seconds of video free on the house :) I wish I could provide more for free but the API costs are quite significant.</p> <p><strong>Only pay for what you use. No subscriptions</strong></p> <p>I'm not a fan of subscriptions either. So instead of a monthly subscription, &quot;Seconds packs&quot; are available to refill seconds when you need them.</p> <p><strong>Wait... Aren't AI generated videos usually garbage?</strong></p> <p>I'm optimistic that we can use AI to create high-quality content that provides real value to viewers. That's why my primary goal is to continue to improve the quality of the output videos. It's clear there's still plenty of room for improvement with the scripts, images and voice quality, but I think the quality is often surprisingly good! And of course, AI tools are getting better, cheaper, and faster each day, and that will lead to automatic improvements to video quality over time.</p> <p><strong>What do you think of AI generated videos? Will tools like EasyVid lead to a good future or will it cause more harm than good?</strong></p> <p>I've received both positive and negative responses from various communities on Reddit when posting about AI generated videos and I'm open to your respectful, constructive criticism. My mind is open because the AI landscape is changing so rapidly, it would be stupid to remain stubborn! Please share your thoughts, I would love to hear what you think! </p> <p><strong>TLDR:</strong><br /> Make videos with AI in a single click based on a simple text prompt.

They asked some questions about it and we got off on a tangent so eventually I asked, &quot;so did I get the job?&quot; and the AI said &quot;sorry, but your answers do not fit the qualifications for a Business Analyst.&quot; And that's freaky cause in reality I just graduated college and have been applying to BA jobs for the past few months....I asked the AI how they got Business Analyst and it apologized, saying they accidentally got it from another user. What do you guys think? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Traditional_Dress880"> /u/Traditional_Dress880 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/16xji3b/character_ai_knew_some_information_about_me/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/16xji3b/character_ai_knew_some_information_about_me/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

                <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>When visualizing the inner workings of vision transformers (ViTs), researchers noticed weird spikes of attention on random background patches. This didn't make sense since the models should focus on foreground objects.</p> <p>By analyzing the output embeddings, they found a small number of tokens (2%) had super high vector norms, causing the spikes.</p> <p>The high-norm &quot;outlier&quot; tokens occurred in redundant areas and held less local info but more global info about the image.</p> <p>Their hypothesis is that ViTs learn to identify unimportant patches and recycle them as temporary storage instead of discarding. This enables efficient processing but causes issues.</p> <p>Their fix is simple - just add dedicated &quot;register&quot; tokens that provide storage space, avoiding the recycling side effects.</p> <p>Models trained with registers have:</p> <ul> <li>Smoother and more meaningful attention maps</li> <li>Small boosts in downstream performance</li> <li>Way better object discovery abilities</li> </ul> <p>The registers give ViTs a place to do their temporary computations without messing stuff up. Just a tiny architecture tweak improves interpretability and performance. Sweet!</p> <p>I think it's cool how they reverse-engineered this model artifact and fixed it with such a small change. More work like this will keep incrementally improving ViTs.</p> <p>TLDR: Vision transformers recycle useless patches to store data, causing problems.

The physical location in this scenario serves as a limiting factor for real-time impact. Congressmen would be sealed off both visually and auditorically, and so the immediacy required to influence a decision as it's happening wouldn't be present.</p> <p>Furthermore, given that the certification process is a formal procedure dictated by law, it's not open to spontaneous alteration based on external public sentiment, especially if that sentiment isn't even perceptible to those inside. The lawmakers are there to execute a constitutional mandate, not to gauge public mood minute-by-minute.</p> <p>So, if the objective is to directly impact the certification process, standing outside the Capitol gates wouldn't cut it. It lacks the tactical elements of visibility and audibility to those making the decisions, and it doesn't interact with the formal, law-bound procedures happening inside the building. Therefore, it would neither delay nor stop the certification.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Georgeo57"> /u/Georgeo57 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/16x92fp/cgpt4_explain_that_for_them_to_stand_outside_of/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/16x92fp/cgpt4_explain_that_for_them_to_stand_outside_of/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

We delve into the burning question: Are Large Language Models (LLMs) poised to replace traditional search engines? Dive into this comprehensive rundown and discover the evolution and future of search in the age of AI.</h1> <h1>Amazon to Invest $4B in Anthropic</h1> <p>Amazon will invest up to $4 billion in Anthropic. The agreement is part of a broader collaboration to develop the industry's most reliable and high-performing foundation models. Anthropic‚Äôs frontier safety research and products, together with Amazon Web Services‚Äô (AWS) expertise in running secure, reliable infrastructure, will make Anthropic‚Äôs safe and steerable AI widely accessible to AWS customers. AWS will become Anthropic‚Äôs primary cloud provider for mission-critical workloads, and this will also expand Anthropic‚Äôs support of Amazon Bedrock.</p> <h1>Meta to develop a ‚Äòsassy chatbot‚Äô for younger users</h1> <p>Meta has plans to develop dozens of chatbot ‚Äòpersonas‚Äô geared toward engaging young users with more colorful behavior. It also includes ones for celebrities to interact with their fans and some more geared towards productivity, such as to help with coding and other tasks.</p> <p>&#x200b;</p> <p>&#x200b;</p> <h1>Meta AI: The new ChatGPT rival was trained on your posts</h1> <p>Meta's new AI assistant, a potential rival to ChatGPT, is being trained using public posts from Facebook and Instagram.</p> <p><strong>Meta AI: ChatGPT's Rival</strong></p> <p>Introduction to Meta AI: Launched at Meta Connect 2023, Meta AI aims to become a prominent assistant across platforms such as Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook.</p> <p>Capabilities: Beyond just providing information like ChatGPT, it will perform tasks across various platforms and is set to integrate with products like the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses and Quest 3.</p> <p>Training on Your PostsData: The unique edge of Meta AI comes from its training on public posts from Facebook and Instagram, essentially learning from users' informal content or &quot;sh*tposts.&quot;</p> <p>Respecting Privacy: Meta takes care to not use private posts or messages for training, emphasizing the respect of user privacy.</p> <p>&#x200b;</p> <p>&#x200b;</p> <h1>The NSA is establishing an ‚ÄúArtificial Intelligence Security Center‚Äù</h1> <p>The NSA is creating a new center focused on promoting secure AI development and defending U.S. advances from foreign adversaries aiming to co-opt the technology.</p> <p>The AI Security Center: Aims to help spur the secure integration of AI capabilities.</p> <p>Will develop best practices and risk management frameworks.goal is to understand and combat threats to U.S. AI advances.</p> <p>Motivations: The U.S. currently leads in AI, but the advantage is precarious.</p> <p>Adversaries have long stolen intellectual property.Agencies are adopting AI rapidly across missions.I will work with industry, labs, and academia on priorities.</p> <p>It comes after an NSA study showed the need to prioritize security.Must understand AI vulnerabilities and counter-threats.</p> <p>TL;DR: The NSA is establishing an AI Security Center to promote secure development and adoption of AI while defending U.S. progress from adversaries aiming to exploit the technology.</p> <h1>LongLoRA: Efficient fine-tuning of long-context LLMs</h1> <p>New research has introduced LongLoRA, an ultra-efficient fine-tuning method designed to extend the context sizes of pre-trained LLMs without a huge computation cost.Typically, training LLMs with longer context sizes consumes a lot of time and requires strong GPU resources. For example, extending the context length from 2048 to 8192 increases computational costs 16 times, particularly in self-attention layers. LongLoRA makes it way cheaper by:</p> <p><strong>1. Using sparse local attention instead of dense global attention (optional at inference time).</strong> </p> <p><strong>2. Using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for context extension</strong></p> <p>This approach seems both easy to use and super practical. LongLoRA performed strongly on various tasks using LLaMA-2 models ranging from 7B/13B to 70B. Notably, it extended LLaMA-2 7B from 4k context to 100k and LLaMA-2 70B to 32k on a single 8x A100 machine, all while keeping the original model architectures intact.</p> <h1>Biggest Boom in AI: ChatGPT Talks and Beyond</h1> <p>OpenAI is introducing voice and image capabilities in ChatGPT, allowing users to have voice conversations and show images to ChatGPT. This new feature offers a more intuitive interface and expands the ways in which ChatGPT can be used. Users can have live conversations about landmarks, get recipe suggestions by showing pictures of their fridge, and even receive math problem hints by sharing photos. The voice and image capabilities will be rolled out to Plus and Enterprise users over the next two weeks, with voice available on iOS and Android and images available on all platforms.</p> <p>ChatGPT can now comprehend images, including photos, screenshots, and text-containing documents, using its language reasoning abilities. You can also discuss multiple images and utilize their new drawing tool to guide you.</p> <h1>Getty Images‚Äôs new AI art tool powered by NVIDIA</h1> <p>Getty Images has launched a generative AI art tool called Generative AI, which uses an AI model provided by Nvidia to render images from text descriptions. The tool is designed to be &quot;commercially safer&quot; than rival solutions, with safeguards to prevent disinformation and copyright infringement. Getty Images will compensate contributors whose work is used to train the AI generator and share revenues generated from the tool. The tool can be accessed on Getty's website or integrated into apps and websites through an API, with pricing based on prompt volume. Other companies, including Bria and Shutterstock, are also exploring ethical approaches to generative AI.</p> <h1>AWS has announced 5 major generative AI updates and innovations</h1> <p><strong>Amazon Bedrock</strong> is now generally available.Amazon Titan Embeddings is now generally available.</p> <p>**Meta‚Äôs Llama 2 is coming to Amazon Bedrock in the next few weeks.</p> <p>**New Amazon CodeWhisperer capability is coming soon, will allow customers to securely customize CodeWhisperer suggestions using their private code base to unlock new levels of developer productivity.</p> <p>New generative BI authoring capabilities in Amazon QuickSight to help business analysts easily create and customize visuals using natural-language commands.</p> <h1>Colossal-AI‚Äôs commercial-free LLM saving thousands</h1> <p>Colossal-AI has released Colossal-LLaMA-2, an open-source and commercial-free domain-specific language model solution. It uses a relatively small amount of data and training time, resulting in lower costs. The Chinese version of LLaMA-2 has outperformed competitors in various evaluation benchmarks. The release includes improvements such as vocabulary expansion, a data cleaning system, and a multi-stage pre-training scheme to enhance Chinese and English abilities.</p> <p>&#x200b;</p> <h1>OpenAI eyes $90B valuation, dives into AI hardware</h1> <p>OpenAI is in discussions to possibly sell shares, a a move that would boost its valuation from $29 billion to somewhere between $80 billion and $90 billion, according to a Wall Street Journal report citing people familiar with the talks.In other news, Apple's former design chief, Jony Ive, and OpenAI CEO, Sam Altman, have reportedly been discussing building a new AI hardware device. It is unclear what the device would be or if they will build it, but the duo has been discussing what new hardware for the AI age could look like.</p> <h1>Vectara launches Boomerang, the next-gen LLM redefining GenAI accuracy</h1> <p>Outpacing major competitors, Boomerang sets a new benchmark in Grounded Generative AI for business applications. It is a next-generation neural information retrieval model integrated into Vectara's GenAI platform.Boomerang surpasses Cohere in benchmark performance and matches OpenAI on certain metrics, excelling particularly in multilingual benchmarks. Notably, it prioritizes security, reducing bias, copyright concerns, and &quot;hallucinations&quot; in AI-generated content. It also offers cross-lingual support for hundreds of languages and dialects and improves prompt understanding, leading to more accurate and faster responses.</p> <h1>Google's 25-year AI legacy guides its future AI innovations</h1> <p>On its 25th birthday, Google reflected on its two-and-a-half decades of pioneering achievements in the field of AI. It started in 2001 using a simple ML to suggest better spellings for web searches.A standout moment in 2023 was the introduction of PaLM 2 and Gemini. It is now looking forward to these models driving the next quarter-century of its AI advancements.</p> <h1>Google‚Äôs AI for hyper-personalized Maps</h1> <p>Google and DeepMind have built an AI algorithm to make route suggestions in Google Maps more personalized. It includes 360 million parameters and uses real driving data from Maps users to analyze what factors they consider when making route decisions. The AI calculations include information such as travel time, tolls, road conditions, and personal preferences.The approach uses Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), which learns from user behavior, and Receding Horizon Inverse Planning (RHIP), which uses different AI techniques for short- and long-distance travel. Tests show that RHIP improves the accuracy of suggested routes for two-wheelers by 16 to 24 percent and should get better at predicting which route they prefer over time.</p> <h1>The Rise and Potential of LLM-Based Agents: A survey</h1> <p>Probably the most comprehensive overview of LLM-based agents, this survey-cum-research covers everything from how to construct AI agents to how to harness them for good. It starts by tracing the concept of agents from its philosophical origins to its development in AI and explains why LLMs are suitable foundations for AI agents.
