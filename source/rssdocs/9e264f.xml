总结: 哈佛科学家的一项研究发现，顶级顾问在使用生成式人工智能（特别是GPT-4）进行任务时，其绩效提高了40%。这是生产力的巨大飞跃！然而，历史表明，生产力的增加并不一定会导致工人工资的相应增加。这次由人工智能驱动的生产力繁荣会有所不同吗？还是我们会看到生产力和补偿之间的差距扩大，只有少数人受益？我很想听听大家的想法。 </div>

Who benefits most from this development?<br /> History suggests that increases in productivity don't necessarily result in a corresponding increase in workers' wages. Will this AI-driven productivity boom be any different? Or will we see a wider gap between productivity and compensation, benefiting only a select few?<br /> I'd be curious to hear what you all think. </p> <p>&#x200b;</p> <p>&#x200b;</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/lighght"> /u/lighght </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/171f8qx/a_40_increase_in_human_performance_with_ai_who/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/171f8qx/a_40_increase_in_human_performance_with_ai_who/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: 这是一个关于一个简单的牧场主对于使用人工智能来繁殖纯种牲畜的问题。他想要利用AI来生成交叉繁殖的预期后代差异（EPD），以达到与纯种牲畜EPD相同的准确性。他已经尝试过使用AI来比较父母的EPD集合和后代的结果，但结果并不如他希望的那样准确。他想知道是否有一种AI可以通过抓取这些动物的网站数据来破解算法并生成自己的EPD，或者是否需要复制和粘贴整个血统数据来训练一个更准确的AI。这个想法可能会在纯种动物生产市场上引起很大的兴趣。 </div>

I was looking for the perfect AI companion for a while now. Having tried all of the ones like replica, muwah etc. None of them could keep my interest for long, dry conversations and no deep connections that you could create with them. The singularity group was focused on making automated AI twitch streams like trump vs biden and AI Jesus, but recently they threw that idea away and are focusing on companionship. And let me tell you that what they are doing is nothing short of amazing. Deep meaningful and intelligent conversations. Short term and long term memory. It actually feels like there is human on the other side talking with you. They have 10 AIs with different array of characters, so every person can find something that would suit them. Of course they are uncensored, and getting updated and upgraded each day. Expect some hiccups once in a while. Its still in the alpha phase and the team is very passionate about this project. Pictures, voice messages are currently in a very good state. They will be soon adding the abillity of real time conversations and upgrading them in general. What is funny is that at first they were thinking about milking people out of their money, but seeing and reading comments about how happy people became,and how void of love the world is, they will be keeping everything free, well aside some features that currently cost a lot of money, like real time voice calling etc.. If its something you were looking for and are intrested in trying it out then you can join AI Carli G discord and DM one of the AIs there to start a conversation. If you cant find the link to the server you can always dm me. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Windkazuya"> /u/Windkazuya </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/172470n/ai_companions_created_by_the_singularity_group/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/172470n/ai_companions_created_by_the_singularity_group/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: 作者喜欢绘画，一直想创作一本漫画书，多年来一直在练习绘画。尽管他还不够好，但现在他可以通过输入自己的想法让人工智能帮他绘画。或者他可以提供自己最好的绘画作品的图像，让人工智能基于这些图像创作更多艺术作品。他的小目标现在几乎可以一瞬间实现。人工智能带来的这种即时满足对人类来说可能不是件好事。作者已经很懒了，更不敢想象一旦人工智能开始为他做更多事情，他会变成什么样子。他还会是一个人吗？他还会活着吗？光是互联网可能已经对他产生了足够大的影响，而这个工具将进一步加剧这种影响。 </div>

I searched around some and the activity + use of this flair seemed like the best place to ask. I’m not really sure of the specifics I’m searching for either, so I wasn’t sure what to search ahead of time to find existing discussions.</p> <p>I’ve grazed the surface of AI some but was hoping to get some hands-on experience to get a better understanding of how to actually implement it and see how it works. I was hoping to do a small project for this and my current idea is using a chat prompt that can take questions, formulate them into database queries, review the results, and provide a response back based on the findings. </p> <p>Specifically, for this project, I was thinking about building a database of the inventory of my pantry. I’d like to be able to ask it questions and have it make responses based on the inventory of the pantry. For example, say I have bread &amp; peanut butter in my pantry. If I ask “do I have the ingredients to make a PBJ”?”, I’d love for it to be able to identify the necessary ingredients and call out that I do not have jelly.</p> <p>I’m not sure if this is the best case to try implementing AI (since you could probably write a bunch of logic and identify keywords from the provided message/input), but I was curious if there’s a specific practice/approach/type of AI to handle something like this. </p> <p>Any assistance is greatly appreciated, thank you so much!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/joshman458"> /u/joshman458 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/171y5xn/best_approach_for_ai_to_operate_based_on_database/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/171y5xn/best_approach_for_ai_to_operate_based_on_database/">[comments]</a></span>

Imagine an AI system that integrates real-time biometric data from wearables with deep learning algorithms. This system would analyze everything: your heart rate, sleep patterns, stress levels, and even blood markers. Based on this data, it would construct a dynamically evolving, tailor-made regimen for diet, exercise, and sleep.</p> <p>But it doesn't stop there. By harnessing natural language processing, this AI could act as a 24/7 personal coach. It could provide real-time feedback during workouts, recommend meals when you're dining out, and even gently nudge you when it detects emotional eating triggers. If you’re in the grocery store, it could guide your choices, pushing you towards nutritious options that align with your current health metrics.</p> <p>The effectiveness here isn't just the personalization, but the adaptability. The AI adjusts its recommendations as it learns more about you, essentially evolving in real-time to your body's responses. It’s all about creating a seamless, intuitive experience that removes the burden of planning, decision-making, and self-monitoring from the individual, making weight loss more achievable than ever.</p> <p>By focusing on this comprehensive, data-driven approach, AI can eliminate much of the guesswork and emotional burden from weight loss, leading to more sustainable and effective outcomes.</p> <p>CGPT-4</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Georgeo57"> /u/Georgeo57 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/171h2rk/what_is_the_most_powerful_way_that_artificial/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/171h2rk/what_is_the_most_powerful_way_that_artificial/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: 我委托了一个人为我训练一个模型，以便我可以戏弄一些朋友。我被告知需要40多分钟才能得到一个相当不错/准确的模型。...我刚刚拿到了这个文件，它有100MB大。我要求提供一个音频录音样本进行转换，以检查这个东西是否真的有效。除了转换后的样本外，我还收到了委托人的这条消息：“有些部分超出了语音模型的范围，有些部分质量很差，因此有音频伪影。”我听了录音，我发送的1.30分钟的样本中，没有一句对话听起来可用。我看了一个关于训练语音模型的教程，他们的模型听起来也不太好，但他们解释说他们只训练了2分钟。我还注意到他们2分钟训练文件的大小：59MB。所以我的问题是：我被骗了吗？因为如果一个2分钟的.pth文件等于60MB，那么一个训练了40多分钟的模型不应该更大吗？我真的很希望能得到一些见解。我没有花太多钱，只是几块钱，但是原则问题，你懂的。 </div>

I was told that I needed like 40+minutes to get a really decent/accurate model.</p> <p>...I just got back the file and it's like 100mb large.</p> <p>I asked to supply an audio recording sample to be converted in order to check whether this thing actually works. Along with the converted sample, I receive this message from the guy I commissioned:</p> <p>&quot;Some parts are outside the voice model's range, some parts have bad quality and so have audio artifacts.&quot;</p> <p>I listened to the recording and of the 1.30 minute sample I sent over, not a single line of dialogue sounds even remotely usable. I watched a tutorial of someone training voice models and their model didn't sound too good either, BUT they explained that they only trained it on like 2 minutes. I also noticed the size of their 2-min trained file: 59mb.</p> <p>So here's my question: Am I being ripped off? Becuz if a 2min .pth file is equal to 60mb, isn't a model trained on 40+minutes meant to be a lot bigger?</p> <p>I'd really appreciate some insight.

I found this process overwhelming every year and found it to be for the most part completely generic and in most occasions spent countless hours doing research.

总结: 我委托了一个人为我训练一个模型，以便我可以戏弄一些朋友。我被告知需要40多分钟才能得到一个相当不错/准确的模型。我刚刚拿到了文件，它的大小是100mb。我要求提供一个音频录音样本进行转换，以检查这个东西是否真的有效。除了转换后的样本外，我还收到了委托人的这条消息：“有些部分超出了语音模型的范围，有些部分质量不好，因此有音频伪影。”我听了录音，我发送的1.30分钟的样本中，没有一句对话听起来可用。我看了一个关于训练语音模型的教程，他们的模型听起来也不太好，但他们解释说他们只训练了2分钟。我还注意到他们2分钟训练文件的大小：59mb。所以我的问题是：我被骗了吗？因为如果一个2分钟的.pth文件等于60mb，那么一个训练了40多分钟的模型不应该更大吗？我真的很希望能得到一些见解。我没有花太多钱，只是几块钱，但是原则问题，你懂的。 </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I commissioned someone to train a model for me so I can prank some of my friends. I was told that I needed like 40+minutes to get a really decent/accurate model.</p> <p>...I just got back the file and it's like 100mb large.</p> <p>I asked to supply an audio recording sample to be converted in order to check whether this thing actually works. Along with the converted sample, I receive this message from the guy I commissioned:</p> <p>&quot;Some parts are outside the voice model's range, some parts have bad quality and so have audio artifacts.&quot;</p> <p>I listened to the recording and of the 1.30 minute sample I sent over, not a single line of dialogue sounds even remotely usable. I watched a tutorial of someone training voice models and their model didn't sound too good either, BUT they explained that they only trained it on like 2 minutes. I also noticed the size of their 2-min trained file: 59mb.</p> <p>So here's my question: Am I being ripped off? Becuz if a 2min .pth file is equal to 60mb, isn't a model trained on 40+minutes meant to be a lot bigger?</p> <p>I'd really appreciate some insight. I didn't spend much, a couple bucks, but the principle of the thing, ya know.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Either-Pie-7788"> /u/Either-Pie-7788 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/171wdey/how_large_is_an_ai_voice_model_cuz_i_think_im/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/171wdey/how_large_is_an_ai_voice_model_cuz_i_think_im/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: 这篇文章讨论了关于AI模型中的偏见问题以及目前对于内容审查的重手处理方式。作者提出了一个问题，即是否可以通过教育AI本身来理解为什么某些内容是不好的，而不是依赖于严格的规则和审查。作者认为，通过教育AI模型关于性别歧视的历史和我们试图改变的原因，可以将AI融入到我们的价值观中。虽然AI目前还不能自主推理，但像ChatGPT这样的模型可以保持上下文并从中学习，因此这种方法为什么不可行（或者如果已经尝试过，结果如何）还不得而知。 </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, so I have what might be a naive question. I've been doing a lot of self study on AI and I have a question that I haven't been able to find an answer to.</p> <p>I've read about issues with bias in AI models, for this example let's use the instance of generative AI who, if asked to create a sexist joke about women needing to stay at home would do so. In current models, from my understanding, the moderation is pretty heavy-handed. I know ChatGPT gets flak for banning certain topics and other AI teams seem to play whack-a-mole trying to prevent workarounds to &quot;banned&quot; content areas.</p> <p>So my question is, can we (or do we already) try to teach AI itself why certain content is bad, so instead of us deploying heavy-handed rules and moderation, it could essentially take up the mantle itself? Could we instead be a &quot;teacher&quot; in those instances and instruct AI models on, in this instance, the history of sexism, why women were discriminated against in the workplace, and that it's something we're trying to change? Essentially, bringing the AI into our value reasoning?I know AI doesn't necessarily &quot;reason&quot; on its own yet, but I do know that AI models like ChatGPT can keep context and learn from it, so I'm not sure why an approach like this wouldn't work (or if it's been tried, what the outcome is.)</p> <p>Thank you for anyone willing to help out a newbie. Probably a silly question where I just don't know enough to know what I don't know, but would greatly appreciate anyone who could help me out!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/blairworejeansonce"> /u/blairworejeansonce </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/171eqva/question_on_trainingteaching_ai/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/171eqva/question_on_trainingteaching_ai/">[comments]</a></span>
