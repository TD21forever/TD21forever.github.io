<br>
总结: 这篇文章介绍了一种名为GameGPT的AI框架，旨在通过使用多个AI代理自动化游戏开发的繁琐部分。该框架通过将工作流程分解，使得AI代理可以专注于狭窄的角色，从而简化了游戏开发过程。作者认为GameGPT可以消除游戏开发中的重复和机械化元素，从而使开发人员能够专注于创造性的设计挑战。然而，该论文没有提供任何具体的结果或实验证明GameGPT的性能改进。目前，GameGPT似乎主要是概念性的，需要进一步的定量结果来评估其效果。 </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Game dev is super complex nowadays - games have huge codebases, massive teams, and dev cycles dragging on for years. Costs are insane too - budgets can hit $100M+ easily.</p> <p>In a new paper, researchers propose to reverse this trend with an AI framework called GameGPT that automates parts of the dev process using multiple AI agents. Each agent handles a different role (all are fine-tuned from relevant base models):</p> <ul> <li>One agent reviews the game design plan to catch errors</li> <li>Another turns tasks into code implementations</li> <li>Reviewer agents check the code and results</li> <li>A testing agent validates everything works as expected</li> </ul> <p>By breaking up the workflow, GameGPT can simplify things for the AI agents. They just focus on a narrow role versus having one jack-of-all-trades agent.</p> <p>The authors argue GameGPT can eliminate repetitive and rote elements of gamedev like testing. This would free up developers to focus on creative design challenges.</p> <p>However, the GameGPT paper does not include any concrete results or experiments demonstrating improved performance. There is no evidence presented that GameGPT reduces hallucinations, redundancy or development time. The authors mention empirical results support their claims that the architecture is more effective, but none are provided. I could not find any additional support material about this work, like a project website, that I could use to further check into this (maybe someone can share in the comments?).</p> <p>Right now GameGPT seems mostly conceptual. The ideas are interesting but hard to assess without quantitative results.</p> <p><strong>TLDR:</strong> <strong>New GameGPT AI framework aims to automate tedious parts of game development using specialized agents. No concrete results were provided in the paper - someone will need to test this out and report back.</strong></p> <p><a href="https://notes.aimodels.fyi/gamegpt-using-ai-to-automate-game-development/">Full summary here</a>.

Moreover, when those participants, assisted by the AI, moved on to perform the task without assistance, they made the same errors as the AI had made during the previous phase. Thus, participants' responses mimicked AI bias even when the AI was no longer making suggestions. These results provide evidence of human inheritance of AI bias.</p> </blockquote> <p>And a previous <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00560">paper</a> found that co-writing with opinionated language models affects users' views and “shifted their opinions“.</p> <p>These results are not surprising. Imitation is inherent to human psychology — we do it subconsciously if we want it or not, and we anthropomorphize any language producing entities we encounter. Up until now other humans were the only entities on this planet able to produce complex speech, which is exactly the reason why we have no idea how Language Models will influence our own thinking and behavior. These papers suggest that their influence is bigger than many people might think.</p> <p>This influence, subtly making us immitating biases and prejudice embedded in the models, may be countered by establishing a standard for seemingly balanced AI-assistants and making them more accurate. But who’s gonna respect these standards, if they are ever established? Sure there will be ethical balanced models for professional journalists and writers, but what about your angry republican uncle on Facebook who’s using the GOP-GPT to copy paste new outrage into his socmed interface? I don’t think he will give a damn about balanced views.</p> <p>If the past is an indicator, the outrage machine is fueled more by partisan actors influencing your uncle, than seemingly balanced highbrow journalism. A <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2024292118">study</a> in 2021 found “evidence that posts about political opponents are substantially more likely to be shared on social media“ and that “stronger effects were found among political leaders than among news media accounts“. Anybody here really thinks that ethical ballanced AI-models putting out language low on bias is the prefered automatization tool in a media environment like this? I don’t. You uncle and his republican clown will fire up the most radical open source LLM they can find, and make no mistake: Leftwing radicals will do that too.</p> <p>More at this link: <a href="https://goodinternet.substack.com/p/people-inherit-ai-bias">https://goodinternet.substack.com/p/people-inherit-ai-bias</a></p> <p>&#x200b;</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/walt74"> /u/walt74 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/178egu0/people_inherit_aibias/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/178egu0/people_inherit_aibias/">[comments]</a></span>
