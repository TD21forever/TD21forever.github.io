总结: 该文讨论了作者对于开发一个定制化的大型语言模型（LLM）的渴望，该模型能够模仿ChatGPT，并根据作者提供的数据在回答问题方面表现出色。作者提到了一些现有的模型，如Private-GPT和Gpt4all，但他的最终目标是要么从头开始创建一个定制的LLM，要么对现有的模型（如BERT或GPT-7B）进行微调以满足他的独特需求。作者还提到了他正在关注Andrej Karpathy关于构建类似GPT的模型的讲座，但他注意到该模型只能生成类似莎士比亚散文的连续循环文本，而不能回答问题。因此，作者追求的核心目标包括：1. 为回答问题的任务进行有效的数据准备；2. 策略性地选择预训练模型，如BERT或GPT-7B；3. 进行严格的性能评估，采用相关的指标；4. 创建一个高效的推理系统，方便问题输入和回答生成。 </div>

However, I've noticed that the model only generated text akin to Shakespearean prose in a continuous loop instead of answering questions. I'm striving to develop an LLM that excels at answering questions based on the data I provide.</p> <p>The core objectives I'm pursuing encompass: 1. Effective data preparation tailored for question-answering tasks. 2. The strategic selection of a pre-trained model, such as BERT or GPT-7B. 3. Rigorous performance evaluation, employing pertinent metrics. 4. The creation of an efficient inference system that facilitates question input and response generation.</p> <p>Please guide me for this objectives or provide me some resources for the same.</p> <p>DM me if you want to talk in detail.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Relative_Winner_4588"> /u/Relative_Winner_4588 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/16zot8s/private_llm_model/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/16zot8s/private_llm_model/">[comments]</a></span>

<br>
<br>
总结: 这篇文章介绍了一种名为PIT的新方法，它使LLMs能够从人类偏好数据中隐式学习自我改进，而无需提示。与提示方法相比，PIT在提高响应质量方面有很大的改进。通过利用人类偏好数据中的隐含指导，PIT能够自主地与人类偏好更好地对齐，从而无需人类参与。这为LLMs在扩展到新领域或未满足的用例时提供了一个有前景的方向。 </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>LLMs keep getting more capable at generating natural language. But there's always room for improving the quality and alignment of their responses.</p> <p>Typically this requires lots of human effort to collect more training data. So researchers are exploring ways for models to self-improve without human involvement.</p> <p>Many methods use prompting - giving the LLM instructions to critique and refine its responses. But coming up with comprehensive prompts is challenging.</p> <p>The new approach proposed, called PIT, lets models <strong>learn self-improvement implicitly from human preference data instead.</strong> It reformulates reinforcement learning to maximize the gap between an original response and improved response conditioned on the original.</p> <p>This taps into the implicit guidance in the preference data on what constitutes better quality, so no manual rubrics are needed. PIT uses curriculum reinforcement learning - first improving easy references, then switching to the LLM's own samples.</p> <p>Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show PIT significantly outperforms prompting methods like Self-Refine. It improved response quality 7-34% across conditions without any human involvement.</p> <p>This demonstrates a promising direction for LLMs to align better with human preferences autonomously as they learn from experience. No need for human bottlenecks when expanding to new domains or underserved use cases. Very cool!</p> <p><strong>TLDR: New method PIT enables LLMs to implicitly learn to refine themselves from human preference data, no prompts needed. Big improvement over prompting approaches.</strong></p> <p><a href="https://notes.aimodels.fyi/enabling-language-models-to-implicitly-learn-self-improvement/">Full Summary</a></p> <p>Arxiv is here: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00898">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00898</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Successful-Western27"> /u/Successful-Western27 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/16zvta7/new_paper_enabling_language_models_to_implicitly/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/16zvta7/new_paper_enabling_language_models_to_implicitly/">[comments]</a></span>

            <title>MIT, Meta, CMU Researchers: LLMs trained with a finite attention window can be extended to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning</title>

<br>
<br>
总结: GPT-3在流式应用中表现不佳，因为其在超出训练长度的长文本上的性能下降。通过可视化注意力图，研究人员发现LLMs过度关注初始标记作为“注意力汇聚点”，即使这些标记没有意义。这种关注模式限制了注意力的分布。研究人员发现，去除这些汇聚点会导致注意力分数扭曲，从而不稳定预测结果。他们提出的“StreamingLLM”方法简单地缓存了一些初始汇聚点和最近的汇聚点，从而使LLMs能够处理非常长的文本。使用StreamingLLM调整的模型可以平稳处理包含数百万标记的序列，并且比其他方法快22倍。更酷的是，在预训练期间添加一个特殊的“[Sink Token]”进一步提高了流式处理能力。模型只使用这个单一的标记作为锚点。总之，StreamingLLM是一个高效的框架，使LLMs能够在没有任何微调的情况下推广到无限序列长度。 </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>LLMs like GPT-3 struggle in streaming uses like chatbots because their performance tanks on long texts exceeding their training length. I checked out a new paper investigating why windowed attention fails for this.</p> <p>By visualizing the attention maps, the researchers noticed LLMs heavily attend initial tokens as &quot;attention sinks&quot; even if meaningless. This anchors the distribution.</p> <p>They realized evicting these sink tokens causes the attention scores to get warped, destabilizing predictions.</p> <p>Their proposed &quot;StreamingLLM&quot; method simply caches a few initial sink tokens plus recent ones. This tweaks LLMs to handle crazy long texts. Models tuned with StreamingLLM smoothly processed sequences with millions of tokens, and were up to 22x faster than other approaches. </p> <p>Even cooler - adding a special &quot;[Sink Token]&quot; during pre-training further improved streaming ability. The model just used that single token as the anchor. I think the abstract says it best:</p> <blockquote> <p>We introduce StreamingLLM, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a <strong>finite length attention window</strong> to generalize to <strong>infinite sequence length without any fine-tuning</strong>. We show that StreamingLLM can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more.</p> </blockquote> <p>TLDR: LLMs break on long convos. Researchers found they cling to initial tokens as attention sinks. Caching those tokens lets LLMs chat infinitely.</p> <p><a href="https://notes.aimodels.fyi/llm-infinite-context-window-streamingllm/"><strong>Full summary here</strong></a></p> <p><strong>Paper link:</strong> <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.17453.pdf"><strong>https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.17453.pdf</strong></a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Successful-Western27"> /u/Successful-Western27 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/16yr83s/mit_meta_cmu_researchers_llms_trained_with_a/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/16yr83s/mit_meta_cmu_researchers_llms_trained_with_a/">[comments]</a></span>
