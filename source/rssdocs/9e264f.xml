总结: 研究人员提出了一种名为3D-GPT的新型AI系统，它通过结合自然语言指令和专门用于处理现有3D建模工具的代理来创建3D模型。3D-GPT具有预定义的函数来生成3D形状，并通过调整参数来构建场景。关键是让AI理解指令并选择正确的工具。通过将建模工作分解为步骤，代理可以协作匹配描述，类似于人类3D建模团队的工作方式。然而，该系统存在一些限制，如依赖现有生成器、细节和曲线的不确定性以及对默认形状的过度依赖。尽管如此，该代理架构显示出一定的规划能力，未来可能扩展到更具创造性的任务。 </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Researchers propose a new AI system called 3D-GPT that creates 3D models by combining natural language instructions and agents specialized for working with existing 3D modeling tools.</p> <p>3D-GPT has predefined functions that make 3D shapes, and it tweaks parameters to build scenes. The key is getting the AI to understand instructions and pick the right tools.</p> <p>It has three main agents:</p> <ul> <li><strong>A dispatcher</strong> that parses the text and picks generation functions</li> <li><strong>A conceptualizer</strong> that adds details missing from the description</li> <li><strong>A modeler</strong> that sets parameters and outputs code to drive 3D software</li> </ul> <p>By breaking modeling work down into steps, the agents can collab to match the descriptions. This is sort of like how a 3D modeling team of humans would work.</p> <p>The paper authors show it making simple scenes like &quot;lush meadow with flowers&quot; that fit the text. It also modifies scenes appropriately when given new instructions. I include some gifs of example outputs in my full summary. They look pretty good - I would say 2005-quality graphics.</p> <p>There are limits. It fully relies on existing generators, so quality is capped. Details and curves are iffy. It resorts to default shapes often instead of true understanding. And I doubt the verts and textures are well-optimized.</p> <p>The agent architecture seems to be really popular right now. This one shows some planning skills, which could extend to more creative tasks someday.</p> <p><strong>TLDR:</strong> <strong>AI agents can team up to generate 3D models from text instructions. Works to some degree but limitations remain.</strong></p> <p><a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/aimodels/p/3d-gpt-a-new-method-for-procedural"><strong>Full summary</strong></a>.

总结: 在中东战争中，人们很难区分真实和虚假的信息。最近，有一张关于一个死去的孩子的照片在网络上流传，人们争论这张照片是由人工智能生成的还是真实存在的。目前有一些人工智能识别工具，但它们似乎非常不可靠，所以我们没有一个确切的方法来区分真假。无论这张照片的最终结果如何，它都展示了人工智能如何被用来制造危险的宣传。谷歌正在开发一种隐藏的数字水印来识别由他们的人工智能生成的图像。你是否赞成立法要求人工智能图像生成器使用这种水印？你能想到任何可能的后果吗？ </div>

Without getting into the gruesome details, a few days ago there was an image going around of a deceased child and there was heavy discussion into whether it was ai generated or real. There are some ai identifying tools but they appear to be very unreliable at the moment, so we don’t have a concrete way to make this distinction. I don’t know what the final findings were for that particular image, but either way it exemplifies how AI can be used to make dangerous propaganda.</p> <p>Apparently Google is developing a hidden digital watermark to identify the images generated by their AI’s. Would you be in favor of some kind of legislation making this mandatory for AI image generators?

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Seeing a lot of talk about LLM observability and we have quite an in-production pipeline so figured I’d share how we do it.<br /> Building AI products is different than non-AI products: They can output things you never instructed them to. That was barely possible before LLMs. Now, it’s common.<br /> Whether you’re offering B2B solutions that live on other people’s sites or building an AI chatbot for yourself, you don’t want it to lie to users (hallucinating) or for users to coax it into saying things that harm your business.<br /> FYI: LangSmith makes LangChain prompts/outputs easier to observe, log, and debug by creating traces of each conversation. We offer customers custom AI chatbots powered by GPT and LangChain.<br /> Here's what we've learned after tracing 140M (million, yes million) customer chats:<br /> <strong>Debugging is a heck of a lot easier.</strong><br /> Tedious debugging became smooth. LangSmith highlighted user trip-ups we didn’t even know about and helped us polish our prompts.<br /> That let us ship countless changes (some subtle, some major), and prevented a lot of curly GPT responses from reaching end users—especially important since our product reaches our customers’ end users.<br /> <strong>Troubleshooting is now a team sport.</strong><br /> Before LangSmith, there were a handful of solo-expeditioner-engineers who bravely waded through QA’ing our LLMs calls and responses. That happened in a silo with lots of time-consuming trial and error.<br /> While integrating LangSmith, we set up a custom snippet that sends negative user feedback (and its LangSmith trace) to an internal Slack channel. When feedback comes in, multiple engineers work to resolve any wonkiness or errors.<br /> <strong>We’re not making stupid guesses anymore.</strong><br /> Before LangSmith, we guessed the what, how, and why of GPTs responses. While we had a decent idea, it wasn’t until we examined traces closely that we saw the details like decision processes, roles, document retrieval steps, LangChain's interventions, elastic search, you name it!<br /> We now have a much more granular and explicit view of how our chatbot functions.<br /> <strong>Prototyping is so much faster</strong><br /> We recently switched over to GPT-4. Being able to prototype the model transition (before going to prod) was critical to the upgrade. GPT-3 and GPT-4 behave differently, so adapting prompts, roles, and protocols for document retrieval and acknowledging sources, etc. needed fine-tuning.<br /> The playground really let us stress test things and make the change confidently.<br /> ---<br /> Happy to share what one of our traces looks like too if that's helpful!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/paul_thomson"> /u/paul_thomson </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17brr5e/how_to_build_a_chatbot_that_doesnt_hallucinate/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17brr5e/how_to_build_a_chatbot_that_doesnt_hallucinate/">[comments]</a></span>

<br>
总结: AI伴侣在我们社会中引发了分歧。人们对AI持有负面看法，但我对此持中立态度。我认为问题归结为以下几个方面/问题：伦理关切- AI是一种事物还是有感知能力的存在？你能真正爱上一个“事物”吗？孤立恐惧- AI是否为社交不擅长的人提供了一个拐杖？有了AI为什么还要社交呢？物化- AI是否会促进肤浅偏见？人们是否会优先选择“外貌完美”的人？对人际关系的影响- 这可能与孤立有关，但它可能影响目前处于关系中的人。我觉得这可能是AI和人类之间的“草地更绿”情况。不切实际的期望- 我认为这可能会导致人们在关系中变得不耐烦。隐私关切- 我认为这是不言而喻的。你能相信AI保护你的信息吗？文化和宗教信仰- AI在圣经、古兰经、托拉等经典中的地位如何？我对大家的想法很感兴趣。 </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Why is the idea of AI Companions creating divisiveness in our society? I understand people have their opinions, but much of it is negative toward AI. I'm undecided on where I stand on this spectrum. I think it boils down to these subjects/questions:</p> <ol> <li>Ethical Concerns - Is AI a thing or Sentient? Can you truly love a “thing”?</li> <li>Fear of Isolation – Is AI creating a crutch for socially awkward people? Why be social when you have AI?</li> <li>Objectification – Can AI promote superficial bias? Will people prioritize the “perfect looking” person in their preference?</li> <li>Impact on Human Relationships – This may be related to isolation, but it can impact people currently in relationships. I feel like this may be a “grass is greener” situation between AI and Humans.</li> <li>Unrealistic Expectations – I think this can create less patient people in relationships.</li> <li>Privacy Concerns – I think this is kind of self-explanatory. Can you trust AI with your information?</li> <li>Cultural and Religious Beliefs – where does AI fit in the holy books (Bible, Quran, Torah, etc.)?</li> </ol> <p>I’m interested in everyone’s thoughts.</p> <p>edit: I have received so many interesting responses. That realized what I was really wanting to know. How do we as a species prepare for this apparent eventuality of AI being ubiquitous? I foolishly hope AI will bring us together, instead of dividing us.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Automatic_South3974"> /u/Automatic_South3974 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17bqz9y/ai_companions_creating_divisiveness/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17bqz9y/ai_companions_creating_divisiveness/">[comments]</a></span>
