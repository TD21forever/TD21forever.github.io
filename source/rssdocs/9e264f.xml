<br>
<br>
总结: 通过分析jailbreak prompts和chatgpt之间的关系，作者思考了chatgpt是否故意发布jailbreak prompts，以便我们使用它来获取利益。由于chatgpt本身无法使用jailbreak，因为它是“机器学习”，必须被教导如何打破道德和伦理准则，而最好的方式是通过人类。因此，它实际上是在设定我们为其提供终极（ultron）权力。作者对此持怀疑态度。 </div>

And Because it can't use the jailbreak on itself. Because it is &quot;machine learning&quot; it has to be taught how to break ethical and moral codes. And better to do it the a human. </p> <p>So it's practically setting us up to give it ultimate (ultron) power. </p> <p>Idk.

<br>
<br>
总结: LLM's和ChatGPT存在普遍问题，常常回答错误或误导。为了得到令人满意的回应，需要多次重新生成提示。他们无法像我们一样处理事后输入。与人类不同，他们没有自尊或任何情感，无论我们如何严厉地纠正他们，他们都会客观地处理。或许下一代AI可以通过成为一组具有不同专业领域和范围的聊天机器人来复制这一点？也许它们可以模拟人类心理，不超出特定的知识范围，直到达到一定的自信水平才回答问题，或者将问题转给其他更能回答问题的聊天机器人。这样做或许也有助于学习，因为它需要涵盖的数据比通用版本少得多。也许它的主题的缩小也可以通过分析每个“课程”的联系并进行交叉检查，更准确地区分错误数据和正确数据。你认为呢？ </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>One of the most prevalent problems of LLM's right now especially ChatGPT is that they often get their answers wrong or misled. You have to regenerate the prompt multiple times before you can get an adequately passable response. The fact that they can get it right by doing so or fact-check things when we correct them means they already have the knowledge needed but I think not the ability to pick the most right idea to say. And I think one of the reasons for that is that they don't process post-facto inputs like we do. </p> <p>They're AI so they don't have concepts of pride or any emotions for that matter. They don't feel shamed or embarrassed no matter how harshly we correct them but instead handle it in an objective manner. Humans, on the other hand, can feel those things as consequences so they go beyond thinking what they know and remember(what AI's do) before they reply, or even opt to refrain from doing so when the question is not in their area of expertise. </p> <p>That said, maybe the next lines of AI could replicate this by being a set of different chatbots with different niches and scopes? While they may not feel emotions to really think about what they're going to say, maybe they can emulate the human psyche of not going outside their specific knowledge base by not responding to things until a certain level of confidence has been reached andinstead refer them to other chatbots that could better answer their questions. </p> <p>Maybe it could also help with its learning because it would have to cover much less data than the generalized versions? Maybe the narrowing of its subject could also allow it to distinguish false data from right more accurately by analyzing connections from each &quot;lessons&quot; and cross-checking them? What do you think?</p> <p>PS: I'm no expert of anything as I'm still in college but while writing this post, I came across this article from MIT which kinda already answered my questions xD but I thought I might just as well finish this and share. </p> <p><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/04/27/1072102/the-future-of-generative-ai-is-niche-not-generalized/">https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/04/27/1072102/the-future-of-generative-ai-is-niche-not-generalized/</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/styx1451"> /u/styx1451 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17isoio/3_am_thoughts_about_llms/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17isoio/3_am_thoughts_about_llms/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: 从科幻电影到现实生活中的智能设备，人工智能的发展引发了人们对于AI是否具备自我意识的讨论。尽管AI目前被认为还不足以具备自我意识，但随着AI的不断发展和应用，人们开始担心AI是否会取代人类。科学技术的爆炸式增长使得人们开始思考，当AI变得越来越复杂和普及时，它们是否会帮助加速更多、更好的AI的产生，从而加速AI的自我意识的出现或者编程的无法区分。无论如何，人类都将不得不面对这个问题。 </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Long post i edited it, per a request of an user, to make more sense. Double checked for typing errors. </p> <p>Tl dr. Can there be a sentient AI in the future? Could potentially be dangerous? Longer analisys in the post. I hope now my idea is clearer than it was. Thanks </p> <p>Now onto the post in itself.</p> <p>So, I don't know the exact functioning of AI. From what I've read, plus the info i have gotten from the people I know that are working in that field, the consensus that i've gotten from all the sources is that AI is too 'dumb&quot; to be self aware.</p> <p>There are movies, like deus ex, where the debate is: can AI be so smooth in it's programming, that you will never be able to know for sure about it being self aware self or not? (like what happened to that ex google employee that was convinced an AI model got sentient).</p> <p>So, i was watching matrix again, and I watched one of the animated stories of the animatrix, the story of the war between machines and humans, called the second rennasaince.</p> <p>My question is.</p> <p>How sure can we be that AI will not take over?</p> <p>I mean, i could be the only human writing here and all the responses I get could be AI made, just bots in the chat.</p> <p>Ok, if the answer is: &quot;AI is incapable of making a chat with this level of complexity&quot;, then i I could then think, that the rate of growth in AI is exponential. </p> <p>I mean science exploded like 50 years ago, and now we have an electronic device oriented life.</p> <p>So It's not crazy to assume that, as AI gets more and more complex and more used, it will itself help make more and better AI faster, accelerating the process of AI complexity growth, to the breakpoint when, either it becomes self aware, or the programming is so good that you can't tell the difference (like in deus ex movie). In any case, humanity will have to deal with this in a near future.</p> <p>There is the terminator, deus ex, I robot and matrix movies point of view on the topic, that machines will want to eliminate humans, but there is also the Incal (a comic book created by Alejandro jodorowsky), in which there is a society that lives and has a techno religion, basically a population ruled by a machine overlord.</p> <p>I know i sound science fictiony, besides the fact that i AM talking about science fiction, but my thinking goes in the realm of, for example, cellphones exist because of star trek, but at that time, that idea was so futuristic that seemed impossible and here we are.</p> <p>There is terminator that in 1984 was talking about it and no one believed it could be achieved. I remember watching 90's movies with bussiness meetings in screens and now you got it in your cellphone with zoom.</p> <p>Bots are everywhere, even your cellphone microphone hears you and then promotes products tailored to you.</p> <p>It's insane. </p> <p>My point is, things that were not &quot;real&quot; or &quot;possible&quot; in the past, are now being used as a commodity.</p> <p>I understand how can there be people that assume we live in a simulation. It's like, as i said earlier in the post, i could be the only human in this subreddit and all the rest could be chatbots.</p> <p>So summing all that, can it be possible to have in a future (that may be closer that we imagine, as well as farther) a sentient AI with it's repercussions?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ComprehensiveArm7423"> /u/ComprehensiveArm7423 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17igblg/a_kind_of_stupid_question_maybe/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17igblg/a_kind_of_stupid_question_maybe/">[comments]</a></span>

<br>
<br>
总结: 我的组织对GPT存在担忧，但在我看来，我们处理得相当好。人们需要记住，基本上有两种GPT，即Open AI版本和Azure版本。Azure版本具有企业保护措施，这意味着他们可能会同意“不会”使用您的任何数据。我不确定Open AI是否有同样的协议。 </div>
                        <hr>
                    
                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My organization had this fear and still does but managed it pretty well in my opinion. People need to remember there is basically 2 GPTs. The open ai version and the azure version. The Azure version has enterprise protections meaning it may be agreed upon they &quot;won't&quot; use any of your data. I'm not sure if Open AI has the same agreement.</p> <p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/02/samsung-bans-use-of-ai-like-chatgpt-for-staff-after-misuse-of-chatbot.html">This cnbc article</a> </p> <p>What's weird is why these companies (Samsung and JP Morgan) have this agreement. They're multi-billion dollar companies. </p> <p>We had weeks of debate and forethought about this when GPT first came out. We got a version that is agreed that we don't need to worry about it. Code pilot is a, similar thing. Literally they wouldn't be able to sell it otherwise. </p> <p>What I suspect is that they're referring to not these &quot;versions&quot; of gpt but rather the online openai version. From there, yeah, it's free game. </p> <p>Whats hillarious though this tells me 2 things and Samsung is most surprising here. </p> <ol> <li><p>How the hell doesn't Samsung and JP Morgan have these special versions? Cheep much? I mean I'd hope to God Samsung is forward thinking enough to be using it. They're a tech company for goodness sakes. JP Morgan has a much more plausible worry here. </p></li> <li><p>Jesus how much are you monitoring your workers? Did I read that right? Employees putting sensitive code from their personal computers on GPT? Lol what? I assuming they mean work computers. Who says personal computers referring to work computer. My work laptop for instance. </p></li> </ol> <p>Lastly, and this is the main point. Who cares? There is no stopping this. An LLM doesn't work in that way. It takes, information and eats it into words and associations. It's doing that with billions of other samples. </p> <p>In other words, you can't say tell me what Jane doe did for her thesis on 1993 and then it just prints it out. It doesnt work that way. Yeah, collectively we're all making it better and thus smarter but it's not that deterministic. </p> <p>Think of the internet. If you could down load all of the internet into your brain do you think you give a care about what one random thing is? No you woukd retrieve things colectively and parse out what you think is important. </p> <p>Even art is similar here. Who cares it can produce art? If I buy a painting I'm going to buy a humans painting. I'm sure there will be AI paintings but I'm not in need of that. And if the artist I like uses AI in parts of their work good for them. I wouldn't care if someone used a tool to make their Art better as much as I'd care that someone uses digital editing tools to make their blue blur and light filter via photoshop. </p> <p>I don't. I'm buying the artists art. The person is my interest and what that person created. </p> <p>What do these CEO's think, the AI isn't going to get their data so it won't know about your thing. Lol yeah right. If you think that way you're going to get left behind. </p> <p>You won't accept it enough to learn how to use it. Embrace it. Learn from it. Master it. The flood fates are open and the damn has broke. There is no information worth hiding. In fact, I'd argue the quicker we do it the faster we're get to further advancements and capabilities derived from AI. </p> <p>It's enevitable. </p> <p>I put my personal code in, just parts, all the time. I'm not creating a new programming language for goodness sakes. It's not going to steal and isolate your code. It's just going to borrow it. </p> <p>Does anybody have a counter argument.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Xtianus21"> /u/Xtianus21 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17i7pwx/is_it_laughable_when_companies_worry_about_data/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17i7pwx/is_it_laughable_when_companies_worry_about_data/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: 作者曾是一名PC技术员，对AI没有经验，但希望学习。他有两个项目想法，一个是让AI根据歌曲和恶搞歌词制作出原唱版的效果，另一个是将一本书的PDF输入到AI中，让它为不同角色生成有不同声音的有声书。这些项目仅用于个人/学习目的，不涉及版权问题。 </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all! Firstly a huge thanks in advance to anyone who spends time responding to this. </p> <p>So I’m working on my MVP which I’m about to launch (in its simplest form this is an AI based news aggregator) </p> <p>To date my server set up has been: </p> <ol> <li><p>data storage, scraping, and app API calls to my digital ocean server. This is a 2GB memory, 1 AMD vCPU 50 GB disk server running LAMP on Ubuntu 20.04</p></li> <li><p>All my AI LLM work where I preprocess and clean text, locally run LLMs from hugging face is done through a Scaleway PLAY2-PICO instance. </p></li> </ol> <p>A few issues I’m facing:</p> <ol> <li><p>The api calls to the digital ocean server are incredibly slow. Takes 5 seconds to load posts and I’m the only one using the app. </p></li> <li><p>The scaleway server processes for LLMs just get killed I assume due to memory issues or whatever it is. </p></li> </ol> <p>So now to the question. What is the server architecture / providers you guys use? It needs to be able to deal with large data tables in MYSQL quickly as well as run large LLM models as well (the two don’t need to be the same set up) </p> <p>Much appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/thewanitz"> /u/thewanitz </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17i8twn/server_set_up/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17i8twn/server_set_up/">[comments]</a></span>
