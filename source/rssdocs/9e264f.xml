Because they simplify my life and help me focus on other things. I've tested many tools, mostly for essay generation, note-taking, and presentation creation for my classes. For the past few months, I have used Textero.ai for content creation and reference searches. But then I saw the launch of Textero Pro, an updated version. I believe I was one of the first to try out this tool, and I'm now ready to share my thoughts.</p> <p>Website: <a href="https://textero.ai/">https://textero.ai/</a><br /> Pricing: Free and Paid</p> <p>The new version is a convenient AI research assistant for people like me. The reference search functionality has improved. I think the creators of this tool expanded the database of sources. Using the tool is quite simple: enter a topic and it shows the most relevant sources for you.</p> <p>One more advantage: now you can add your own sources (it was impossible in the previous version). The &quot;Ask AI&quot; feature gives detailed information about those sources and even shows PDFs. Plus, there is a handy online editor where you can change your text, like expanding or shortening it. The last step is to download the document on your computer or use Google Docs.</p> <p>What do you think about it?

<br>
<br>
总结: GPT-3在流式应用中表现不佳，因为其在超出训练长度的长文本上的性能下降。通过可视化注意力图，研究人员发现LLMs过度关注初始标记作为“注意力汇聚点”，即使这些标记没有意义。这种关注模式限制了注意力的分布。研究人员发现，去除这些汇聚点会导致注意力分数扭曲，从而不稳定预测结果。他们提出的“StreamingLLM”方法简单地缓存了一些初始汇聚点和最近的汇聚点，从而使LLMs能够处理非常长的文本。使用StreamingLLM调整的模型可以平稳处理包含数百万标记的序列，并且比其他方法快22倍。更酷的是，在预训练期间添加一个特殊的“[Sink Token]”进一步提高了流式处理能力。模型只使用这个单一的标记作为锚点。总之，StreamingLLM是一个高效的框架，使LLMs能够在没有任何微调的情况下推广到无限序列长度。 </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>LLMs like GPT-3 struggle in streaming uses like chatbots because their performance tanks on long texts exceeding their training length. I checked out a new paper investigating why windowed attention fails for this.</p> <p>By visualizing the attention maps, the researchers noticed LLMs heavily attend initial tokens as &quot;attention sinks&quot; even if meaningless. This anchors the distribution.</p> <p>They realized evicting these sink tokens causes the attention scores to get warped, destabilizing predictions.</p> <p>Their proposed &quot;StreamingLLM&quot; method simply caches a few initial sink tokens plus recent ones. This tweaks LLMs to handle crazy long texts. Models tuned with StreamingLLM smoothly processed sequences with millions of tokens, and were up to 22x faster than other approaches. </p> <p>Even cooler - adding a special &quot;[Sink Token]&quot; during pre-training further improved streaming ability. The model just used that single token as the anchor. I think the abstract says it best:</p> <blockquote> <p>We introduce StreamingLLM, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a <strong>finite length attention window</strong> to generalize to <strong>infinite sequence length without any fine-tuning</strong>. We show that StreamingLLM can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more.</p> </blockquote> <p>TLDR: LLMs break on long convos. Researchers found they cling to initial tokens as attention sinks. Caching those tokens lets LLMs chat infinitely.</p> <p><a href="https://notes.aimodels.fyi/llm-infinite-context-window-streamingllm/"><strong>Full summary here</strong></a></p> <p><strong>Paper link:</strong> <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.17453.pdf"><strong>https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.17453.pdf</strong></a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Successful-Western27"> /u/Successful-Western27 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/16yr83s/mit_meta_cmu_researchers_llms_trained_with_a/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/16yr83s/mit_meta_cmu_researchers_llms_trained_with_a/">[comments]</a></span>

Once images were generated in a storyboard, video was generated. I then cut and edited this somewhat in final cut to fit the music better. But nonetheless it is wild to see.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FazRazza"> /u/FazRazza </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/16ymtj2/i_made_a_music_video_using_ai_and_final_cut_pro_x/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/16ymtj2/i_made_a_music_video_using_ai_and_final_cut_pro_x/">[comments]</a></span>

<br>
总结: 研究人员通过教授语言模型使用数学工具来解决复杂的数学问题。他们采用了新的“工具集成推理”格式，通过自然语言生成计划并调用数学工具来解决方程。通过交替使用自然语言和符号计算，他们既能获得语言模型的语义理解，又能得到工具的严谨数学计算。这种工具集成的推理方法显著提高了数学能力，即使对于像GPT-4这样的大型模型也是如此。然而，涉及几何和高级代数的复杂问题仍然存在。进一步推进可能需要新的符号推理和空间理解技术。总体而言，工具集成似乎是提高推理能力的一条有希望的途径，将其应用于其他领域如逻辑和编程也可能产生重要影响。 </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>When trying to get language models to solve complex math problems, researchers kept running into limits. Models like GPT-3 and ChatGPT still struggle with advanced algebra, calculus, and geometry questions. The math is just too abstract and symbol-heavy for them.</p> <p>To break through this barrier, researchers from Tsinghua University and Microsoft taught models to combine natural language reasoning with calling external math tools.</p> <p>The key is their new &quot;tool-integrated reasoning&quot; format. Models generate a natural language plan first, then write code to invoke tools like SymPy to solve equations. They take the output results and continue verbal reasoning.</p> <p>By interleaving natural language and symbolic computations, they get the best of both worlds - semantic understanding from language models and rigorous math from tools.</p> <p>They trained versions of the LLaMA model this way, producing their Tool-Integrated Reasoning Agent (TORA). They present some strong results:</p> <ul> <li>In evaluations on 10 math datasets, TORA substantially outperformed prior state-of-the-art methods, achieving 13-19% higher accuracy on average.</li> <li>On one competition test, TORA-7B scored 40% accuracy, beating the previous best model by 22 percentage points.</li> </ul> <p>This demonstrates that integrating tools directly into the reasoning process can significantly enhance mathematical capabilities, even for large models like GPT-4.</p> <p>However, tough problems involving geometry and advanced algebra are still there. New techniques for symbolic reasoning and spatial understanding will likely be needed to push further.</p> <p>Overall though, tool integration seems a promising path to improve reasoning skills. Applying this to other domains like logic and programming could also be impactful.</p> <p><strong>TLDR:</strong> Teaching language models to use math tools helps them solve way more complex problems.</p> <p><a href="https://notes.aimodels.fyi/researchers-announce-tora-training-language-models-to-better-understand-math-using-external-tools/"><strong>Full Paper Summary</strong></a></p> <p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.17452.pdf"><strong>arXiv Link</strong></a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Successful-Western27"> /u/Successful-Western27 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/16y16et/new_research_teaching_llms_to_use_math_tools/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/16y16et/new_research_teaching_llms_to_use_math_tools/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: EasyVid是一个使用AI技术生成视频的工具，它可以根据简单的文本提示生成完整的视频。EasyVid可以自动添加配音、字幕、音乐和背景视觉效果，只需输入脚本，EasyVid就会完成剩下的工作。这个工具最初是作为一个实验开始的，开发者通过使用AI自动生成YouTube视频的方式创建了一个自动化的YouTube频道。经过几个月的开发，EasyVid得到了很多用户的请求，于是开发者决定进一步完善并公开发布这个工具。 </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello! I would like to share my tool <a href="https://easyvid.xyz/">EasyVid</a>. EasyVid generates full videos from a simple text prompt! EasyVid adds voiceovers, subtitles, music, and background visuals automatically. All you need to do is enter a script and EasyVid does the rest :)</p> <p><strong>What is EasyVid?</strong></p> <p>EasyVid started as an experiment to see if I could use AI to automatically generate Youtube videos. After a weekend of coding, I created an automated Youtube channel. A few months ago I posted some of my videos to Reddit and I got a bunch of requests for the tool. So I decided to develop it further and make it publicly available!</p> <p><strong>Who am I?</strong></p> <p>I'm the solo developer for EasyVid. It's a side project and it's been very exciting building everything myself. I have learned a lot so far and the journey is just getting started :)</p> <p><strong>How to use EasyVid</strong></p> <p>I wanted to make it as easy as possible to make videos (hence the name), so it's just 3 steps:</p> <ol> <li>Type or paste in your script</li> <li>Adjust any settings (voice, language, aspect ratio, etc.)</li> <li>Click &quot;Generate video&quot;</li> </ol> <p>A few minutes later, you'll get a full video (.mp4 file) with an AI voiceover, automatic subtitles, AI-generated background visuals, and music!</p> <p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p> <p>- <strong>Voiceover:</strong> A narrator reads out your script with a very realistic, humanlike voice. I'm using Elevenlabs for text-to-speech and it's been really good! They seem to have the best audio quality by far compared to any other competitors at the moment.</p> <p>- <strong>Subtitles:</strong> These are automatically generated from the script and lined up with the audio. No AI here really but many people ask about this step. </p> <p>- <strong>Background Visuals:</strong> This tool generates background images using Stable Diffusion, an AI image generator. The images are custom prompted to match the content of the script. This makes it useful for creative video styles like stories and poems. I am really looking forward to DALLE-3 however and will likely switch once they make the API available!</p> <p>After everything is generated, it all gets stitched together and saved to a .mp4 file, ready to download!</p> <p><strong>Free to try</strong></p> <p>Everyone gets 40 seconds of video free on the house :) I wish I could provide more for free but the API costs are quite significant.</p> <p><strong>Only pay for what you use. No subscriptions</strong></p> <p>I'm not a fan of subscriptions either. So instead of a monthly subscription, &quot;Seconds packs&quot; are available to refill seconds when you need them.</p> <p><strong>Wait... Aren't AI generated videos usually garbage?</strong></p> <p>I'm optimistic that we can use AI to create high-quality content that provides real value to viewers. That's why my primary goal is to continue to improve the quality of the output videos. It's clear there's still plenty of room for improvement with the scripts, images and voice quality, but I think the quality is often surprisingly good! And of course, AI tools are getting better, cheaper, and faster each day, and that will lead to automatic improvements to video quality over time.</p> <p><strong>What do you think of AI generated videos? Will tools like EasyVid lead to a good future or will it cause more harm than good?</strong></p> <p>I've received both positive and negative responses from various communities on Reddit when posting about AI generated videos and I'm open to your respectful, constructive criticism. My mind is open because the AI landscape is changing so rapidly, it would be stupid to remain stubborn! Please share your thoughts, I would love to hear what you think! </p> <p><strong>TLDR:</strong><br /> Make videos with AI in a single click based on a simple text prompt.
