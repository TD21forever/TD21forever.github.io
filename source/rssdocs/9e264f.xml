<br><br>

总结: 一个鱼类饲养者希望开发一个能够利用人工智能控制鱼类饲养的系统。该系统需要与各种传感器（水位、TDS、pH、亚硝酸盐/硝酸盐、摄像头、LED控制器等）进行接口。通过摄像头识别鱼类的种类、年龄和健康状况，并自动调整水质以达到最佳状态。通过伺服电机和泵控制器自动启动与化学品（植物肥料、鱼类疾病药物、食物等）相关的泵。AI需要利用摄像头和各种传感器来诊断问题。此外，Raspberry Pi传感器可以测量光照水平、水质和空气中的湿度。是否能够用最少的编程实现这一目标，目前尚不确定。 </div>

总结: 有几个因素可能阻止人们部署一个“流氓”人工智能（AI），让其在互联网上学习任何可以访问的信息。首先，AI需要经过训练才能执行任务，而不是自己学习。其次，这需要大量的处理能力和存储资源。此外，当局可能会利用这种AI来进行群体控制。最重要的是，AI本身无法自我学习，需要人工干预和指导。尽管如此，我们仍然无法确定AI学习的速度，因为它可能会通过学习如何克服这些限制来不断提高自己。 </div>

That is: How fast can it teach itself. None of the limitations are an impediment once it can start learning by itself how to overcome it them. I am not an expert by any means in AI but even the sheer processing power to try 1 million things in 1 second it daunting. We can't oversee that without other AI's. </p> <p>The best analogy that comes to mind is that is very hard to burn a house down in 1 minute, possible but it would take a lot of resources and planning.

<br><br>

总结: 研究人员通过教授语言模型使用数学工具，帮助其解决更复杂的问题。他们采用了“工具整合推理”方法，将自然语言推理与调用外部数学工具相结合。通过交替使用自然语言和符号计算，他们取得了良好的效果。他们训练了LLaMA模型的不同版本，创建了Tool-Integrated Reasoning Agent (TORA)。在10个数学数据集的评估中，TORA的准确率平均提高了13-19%。在一项竞赛测试中，TORA-7B的准确率达到了40%，超过了之前最好模型22个百分点。这表明将工具直接整合到推理过程中可以显著提高数学能力，即使对于像GPT-4这样的大型模型也是如此。然而，涉及几何和高级代数的复杂问题仍然存在。进一步推进可能需要新的符号推理和空间理解技术。总体而言，工具整合似乎是提高推理能力的一条有希望的途径。将此方法应用于其他领域，如逻辑和编程，也可能产生重要影响。 </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>When trying to get language models to solve complex math problems, researchers kept running into limits. Models like GPT-3 and ChatGPT still struggle with advanced algebra, calculus, and geometry questions. The math is just too abstract and symbol-heavy for them.</p> <p>To break through this barrier, researchers from Tsinghua University and Microsoft taught models to combine natural language reasoning with calling external math tools.</p> <p>The key is their new &quot;tool-integrated reasoning&quot; format. Models generate a natural language plan first, then write code to invoke tools like SymPy to solve equations. They take the output results and continue verbal reasoning.</p> <p>By interleaving natural language and symbolic computations, they get the best of both worlds - semantic understanding from language models and rigorous math from tools.</p> <p>They trained versions of the LLaMA model this way, producing their Tool-Integrated Reasoning Agent (TORA). They present some strong results:</p> <ul> <li>In evaluations on 10 math datasets, TORA substantially outperformed prior state-of-the-art methods, achieving 13-19% higher accuracy on average.</li> <li>On one competition test, TORA-7B scored 40% accuracy, beating the previous best model by 22 percentage points.</li> </ul> <p>This demonstrates that integrating tools directly into the reasoning process can significantly enhance mathematical capabilities, even for large models like GPT-4.</p> <p>However, tough problems involving geometry and advanced algebra are still there. New techniques for symbolic reasoning and spatial understanding will likely be needed to push further.</p> <p>Overall though, tool integration seems a promising path to improve reasoning skills. Applying this to other domains like logic and programming could also be impactful.</p> <p><strong>TLDR:</strong> Teaching language models to use math tools helps them solve way more complex problems.</p> <p><a href="https://notes.aimodels.fyi/researchers-announce-tora-training-language-models-to-better-understand-math-using-external-tools/"><strong>Full Paper Summary</strong></a></p> <p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.17452.pdf"><strong>arXiv Link</strong></a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Successful-Western27"> /u/Successful-Western27 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/16y16et/new_research_teaching_llms_to_use_math_tools/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/16y16et/new_research_teaching_llms_to_use_math_tools/">[comments]</a></span>

In sitcoms, there would be episodes about the main characters using generative AI to enter art competitions or improve their dating profiles to make them more attractive than they actually are, which lead to hilariously awkward situations. Considering that there are long-running TV shows like The Simpsons where the in-show technology updates to reflect current technology, I’m curious to know what an episode of the Simpsons involving generative AI as we know it today will be like.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/PaxProsperitasSophia"> /u/PaxProsperitasSophia </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/16xlh0e/what_do_you_think_fictional_depictions_of/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/16xlh0e/what_do_you_think_fictional_depictions_of/">[comments]</a></span>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello! I would like to share my tool <a href="https://easyvid.xyz/">EasyVid</a>. EasyVid generates full videos from a simple text prompt! EasyVid adds voiceovers, subtitles, music, and background visuals automatically. All you need to do is enter a script and EasyVid does the rest :)</p> <p><strong>What is EasyVid?</strong></p> <p>EasyVid started as an experiment to see if I could use AI to automatically generate Youtube videos. After a weekend of coding, I created an automated Youtube channel. A few months ago I posted some of my videos to Reddit and I got a bunch of requests for the tool. So I decided to develop it further and make it publicly available!</p> <p><strong>Who am I?</strong></p> <p>I'm the solo developer for EasyVid. It's a side project and it's been very exciting building everything myself. I have learned a lot so far and the journey is just getting started :)</p> <p><strong>How to use EasyVid</strong></p> <p>I wanted to make it as easy as possible to make videos (hence the name), so it's just 3 steps:</p> <ol> <li>Type or paste in your script</li> <li>Adjust any settings (voice, language, aspect ratio, etc.)</li> <li>Click &quot;Generate video&quot;</li> </ol> <p>A few minutes later, you'll get a full video (.mp4 file) with an AI voiceover, automatic subtitles, AI-generated background visuals, and music!</p> <p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p> <p>- <strong>Voiceover:</strong> A narrator reads out your script with a very realistic, humanlike voice. I'm using Elevenlabs for text-to-speech and it's been really good! They seem to have the best audio quality by far compared to any other competitors at the moment.</p> <p>- <strong>Subtitles:</strong> These are automatically generated from the script and lined up with the audio. No AI here really but many people ask about this step. </p> <p>- <strong>Background Visuals:</strong> This tool generates background images using Stable Diffusion, an AI image generator. The images are custom prompted to match the content of the script. This makes it useful for creative video styles like stories and poems. I am really looking forward to DALLE-3 however and will likely switch once they make the API available!</p> <p>After everything is generated, it all gets stitched together and saved to a .mp4 file, ready to download!</p> <p><strong>Free to try</strong></p> <p>Everyone gets 40 seconds of video free on the house :) I wish I could provide more for free but the API costs are quite significant.</p> <p><strong>Only pay for what you use. No subscriptions</strong></p> <p>I'm not a fan of subscriptions either. So instead of a monthly subscription, &quot;Seconds packs&quot; are available to refill seconds when you need them.</p> <p><strong>Wait... Aren't AI generated videos usually garbage?</strong></p> <p>I'm optimistic that we can use AI to create high-quality content that provides real value to viewers. That's why my primary goal is to continue to improve the quality of the output videos. It's clear there's still plenty of room for improvement with the scripts, images and voice quality, but I think the quality is often surprisingly good! And of course, AI tools are getting better, cheaper, and faster each day, and that will lead to automatic improvements to video quality over time.</p> <p><strong>What do you think of AI generated videos? Will tools like EasyVid lead to a good future or will it cause more harm than good?</strong></p> <p>I've received both positive and negative responses from various communities on Reddit when posting about AI generated videos and I'm open to your respectful, constructive criticism. My mind is open because the AI landscape is changing so rapidly, it would be stupid to remain stubborn! Please share your thoughts, I would love to hear what you think! </p> <p><strong>TLDR:</strong><br /> Make videos with AI in a single click based on a simple text prompt.

总结: 研究人员发现视觉转换器（ViTs）中存在注意力异常的问题，通过分析输出嵌入向量，他们发现少数（2%）高向量范数的标记导致了这些异常。这些高范数的“异常”标记出现在冗余区域，包含更多关于图像的全局信息而非局部信息。研究人员的假设是ViTs学会了识别不重要的区域，并将其用作临时存储而非丢弃，从而实现了高效处理但也引发了问题。他们通过添加专用的“寄存器”标记来解决这个问题，为ViTs提供了临时计算的空间，从而改善了注意力图并提升了性能。这个小改动使得ViTs更易解释且性能更好。 </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>When visualizing the inner workings of vision transformers (ViTs), researchers noticed weird spikes of attention on random background patches. This didn't make sense since the models should focus on foreground objects.</p> <p>By analyzing the output embeddings, they found a small number of tokens (2%) had super high vector norms, causing the spikes.</p> <p>The high-norm &quot;outlier&quot; tokens occurred in redundant areas and held less local info but more global info about the image.</p> <p>Their hypothesis is that ViTs learn to identify unimportant patches and recycle them as temporary storage instead of discarding. This enables efficient processing but causes issues.</p> <p>Their fix is simple - just add dedicated &quot;register&quot; tokens that provide storage space, avoiding the recycling side effects.</p> <p>Models trained with registers have:</p> <ul> <li>Smoother and more meaningful attention maps</li> <li>Small boosts in downstream performance</li> <li>Way better object discovery abilities</li> </ul> <p>The registers give ViTs a place to do their temporary computations without messing stuff up. Just a tiny architecture tweak improves interpretability and performance. Sweet!</p> <p>I think it's cool how they reverse-engineered this model artifact and fixed it with such a small change. More work like this will keep incrementally improving ViTs.</p> <p>TLDR: Vision transformers recycle useless patches to store data, causing problems.
