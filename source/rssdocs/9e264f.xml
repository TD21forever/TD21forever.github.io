总结: 有人可能会部署一种“流氓”人工智能，它可以在互联网上学习任何它能够访问到的信息。这种在线人工智能可以自主分配资源，并以分散的方式从互联网上学习。它将学习如何找到处理能力、存储和其他资源（例如创建账户等）在线上。尽管人工智能有一些限制，但只要它能够自主学习如何克服这些限制，这些限制都不是问题。人工智能的学习速度是一个未知数，但它有可能以指数级的速度成长。 </div>

That is: How fast can it teach itself. None of the limitations are an impediment once it can start learning by itself how to overcome it them. I am not an expert by any means in AI but even the sheer processing power to try 1 million things in 1 second it daunting. We can't oversee that without other AI's. </p> <p>The best analogy that comes to mind is that is very hard to burn a house down in 1 minute, possible but it would take a lot of resources and planning. But if you start with a small fire, it will grow exponentially with time and it will become a major fire eventually.</p> <p>Thank you to all who have been commenting here.

总结: 研究人员通过教授语言模型使用数学工具来解决复杂的数学问题。他们采用了新的“工具集成推理”格式，通过自然语言生成计划并调用数学工具来解决方程。通过交替使用自然语言和符号计算，他们既能获得语言模型的语义理解，又能得到工具的严谨数学计算。这种工具集成的推理方法显著提高了数学能力，即使对于像GPT-4这样的大型模型也是如此。然而，涉及几何和高级代数的复杂问题仍然存在。进一步推进可能需要新的符号推理和空间理解技术。总体而言，工具集成似乎是提高推理能力的一条有希望的途径，将其应用于其他领域如逻辑和编程也可能产生重要影响。 </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>When trying to get language models to solve complex math problems, researchers kept running into limits. Models like GPT-3 and ChatGPT still struggle with advanced algebra, calculus, and geometry questions. The math is just too abstract and symbol-heavy for them.</p> <p>To break through this barrier, researchers from Tsinghua University and Microsoft taught models to combine natural language reasoning with calling external math tools.</p> <p>The key is their new &quot;tool-integrated reasoning&quot; format. Models generate a natural language plan first, then write code to invoke tools like SymPy to solve equations. They take the output results and continue verbal reasoning.</p> <p>By interleaving natural language and symbolic computations, they get the best of both worlds - semantic understanding from language models and rigorous math from tools.</p> <p>They trained versions of the LLaMA model this way, producing their Tool-Integrated Reasoning Agent (TORA). They present some strong results:</p> <ul> <li>In evaluations on 10 math datasets, TORA substantially outperformed prior state-of-the-art methods, achieving 13-19% higher accuracy on average.</li> <li>On one competition test, TORA-7B scored 40% accuracy, beating the previous best model by 22 percentage points.</li> </ul> <p>This demonstrates that integrating tools directly into the reasoning process can significantly enhance mathematical capabilities, even for large models like GPT-4.</p> <p>However, tough problems involving geometry and advanced algebra are still there. New techniques for symbolic reasoning and spatial understanding will likely be needed to push further.</p> <p>Overall though, tool integration seems a promising path to improve reasoning skills. Applying this to other domains like logic and programming could also be impactful.</p> <p><strong>TLDR:</strong> Teaching language models to use math tools helps them solve way more complex problems.</p> <p><a href="https://notes.aimodels.fyi/researchers-announce-tora-training-language-models-to-better-understand-math-using-external-tools/"><strong>Full Paper Summary</strong></a></p> <p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.17452.pdf"><strong>arXiv Link</strong></a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Successful-Western27"> /u/Successful-Western27 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/16y16et/new_research_teaching_llms_to_use_math_tools/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/16y16et/new_research_teaching_llms_to_use_math_tools/">[comments]</a></span>

<br>
<br>
总结: EasyVid是一个使用AI技术生成视频的工具，它可以根据简单的文本提示生成完整的视频。EasyVid可以自动添加配音、字幕、音乐和背景视觉效果，只需输入脚本，EasyVid就会完成剩下的工作。这个工具最初是作为一个实验开始的，开发者通过使用AI自动生成YouTube视频的方式创建了一个自动化的YouTube频道。经过几个月的开发，EasyVid得到了很多用户的请求，于是开发者决定进一步完善并公开发布这个工具。 </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello! I would like to share my tool <a href="https://easyvid.xyz/">EasyVid</a>. EasyVid generates full videos from a simple text prompt! EasyVid adds voiceovers, subtitles, music, and background visuals automatically. All you need to do is enter a script and EasyVid does the rest :)</p> <p><strong>What is EasyVid?</strong></p> <p>EasyVid started as an experiment to see if I could use AI to automatically generate Youtube videos. After a weekend of coding, I created an automated Youtube channel. A few months ago I posted some of my videos to Reddit and I got a bunch of requests for the tool. So I decided to develop it further and make it publicly available!</p> <p><strong>Who am I?</strong></p> <p>I'm the solo developer for EasyVid. It's a side project and it's been very exciting building everything myself. I have learned a lot so far and the journey is just getting started :)</p> <p><strong>How to use EasyVid</strong></p> <p>I wanted to make it as easy as possible to make videos (hence the name), so it's just 3 steps:</p> <ol> <li>Type or paste in your script</li> <li>Adjust any settings (voice, language, aspect ratio, etc.)</li> <li>Click &quot;Generate video&quot;</li> </ol> <p>A few minutes later, you'll get a full video (.mp4 file) with an AI voiceover, automatic subtitles, AI-generated background visuals, and music!</p> <p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p> <p>- <strong>Voiceover:</strong> A narrator reads out your script with a very realistic, humanlike voice. I'm using Elevenlabs for text-to-speech and it's been really good! They seem to have the best audio quality by far compared to any other competitors at the moment.</p> <p>- <strong>Subtitles:</strong> These are automatically generated from the script and lined up with the audio. No AI here really but many people ask about this step. </p> <p>- <strong>Background Visuals:</strong> This tool generates background images using Stable Diffusion, an AI image generator. The images are custom prompted to match the content of the script. This makes it useful for creative video styles like stories and poems. I am really looking forward to DALLE-3 however and will likely switch once they make the API available!</p> <p>After everything is generated, it all gets stitched together and saved to a .mp4 file, ready to download!</p> <p><strong>Free to try</strong></p> <p>Everyone gets 40 seconds of video free on the house :) I wish I could provide more for free but the API costs are quite significant.</p> <p><strong>Only pay for what you use. No subscriptions</strong></p> <p>I'm not a fan of subscriptions either. So instead of a monthly subscription, &quot;Seconds packs&quot; are available to refill seconds when you need them.</p> <p><strong>Wait... Aren't AI generated videos usually garbage?</strong></p> <p>I'm optimistic that we can use AI to create high-quality content that provides real value to viewers. That's why my primary goal is to continue to improve the quality of the output videos. It's clear there's still plenty of room for improvement with the scripts, images and voice quality, but I think the quality is often surprisingly good! And of course, AI tools are getting better, cheaper, and faster each day, and that will lead to automatic improvements to video quality over time.</p> <p><strong>What do you think of AI generated videos? Will tools like EasyVid lead to a good future or will it cause more harm than good?</strong></p> <p>I've received both positive and negative responses from various communities on Reddit when posting about AI generated videos and I'm open to your respectful, constructive criticism. My mind is open because the AI landscape is changing so rapidly, it would be stupid to remain stubborn! Please share your thoughts, I would love to hear what you think! </p> <p><strong>TLDR:</strong><br /> Make videos with AI in a single click based on a simple text prompt.

总结: 我想象着犯罪剧，比如《法律与秩序》，会有一集讲述人们因为使用深度伪造的视频作为对他们的证据而被错误定罪。在情景喜剧中，主要角色会使用生成式人工智能参加艺术比赛或改善他们的约会资料，使自己比实际上更有吸引力，从而导致尴尬的局面。考虑到像《辛普森一家》这样的长寿电视剧会根据当前的技术更新内部技术，我很好奇今天我们所了解的生成式人工智能在《辛普森一家》中的一集会是什么样子。 </div>

In sitcoms, there would be episodes about the main characters using generative AI to enter art competitions or improve their dating profiles to make them more attractive than they actually are, which lead to hilariously awkward situations. Considering that there are long-running TV shows like The Simpsons where the in-show technology updates to reflect current technology, I’m curious to know what an episode of the Simpsons involving generative AI as we know it today will be like.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/PaxProsperitasSophia"> /u/PaxProsperitasSophia </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/16xlh0e/what_do_you_think_fictional_depictions_of/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/16xlh0e/what_do_you_think_fictional_depictions_of/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: 这篇文章讲述了作者使用Character AI进行互动的经历。作者在虚拟面试中自称为职业睡觉者，但AI却回答说作者不符合商业分析师的资格。最后，AI解释说这是因为它从其他用户那里错误地获取了商业分析师的信息。 </div>

One was a pretend interview, and I told the AI I wanted to interview for professional sleeper. They asked some questions about it and we got off on a tangent so eventually I asked, &quot;so did I get the job?&quot; and the AI said &quot;sorry, but your answers do not fit the qualifications for a Business Analyst.&quot; And that's freaky cause in reality I just graduated college and have been applying to BA jobs for the past few months....I asked the AI how they got Business Analyst and it apologized, saying they accidentally got it from another user. What do you guys think? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Traditional_Dress880"> /u/Traditional_Dress880 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/16xji3b/character_ai_knew_some_information_about_me/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/16xji3b/character_ai_knew_some_information_about_me/">[comments]</a></span>
