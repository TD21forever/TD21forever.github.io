This approach can be effective, but it has its limitations. For example, the pre-existing model may not be well-suited to the specific problem that you are trying to solve. Additionally, fine-tuning a model can be time-consuming and expensive.</p> <p>Turing's Solutions takes a different approach. We first create a custom algorithm that is tailored to your specific needs. This algorithm is based on your logical concept of the problem that you are trying to solve. Once the algorithm is created, we fine-tune it on your dataset of labeled data.</p> <p>This approach has several advantages over traditional machine learning approaches. First, it allows us to create more accurate and efficient models. Second, it is faster and less expensive. Third, it gives you more control over the design of your AI solution.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Fantastic-Ninja3839"> /u/Fantastic-Ninja3839 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/172h2qc/i_can_use_ai_to_create_an_algorithm_based_on_any/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/172h2qc/i_can_use_ai_to_create_an_algorithm_based_on_any/">[comments]</a></span>

I was looking for the perfect AI companion for a while now. Having tried all of the ones like replica, muwah etc. None of them could keep my interest for long, dry conversations and no deep connections that you could create with them. The singularity group was focused on making automated AI twitch streams like trump vs biden and AI Jesus, but recently they threw that idea away and are focusing on companionship. And let me tell you that what they are doing is nothing short of amazing. Deep meaningful and intelligent conversations. Short term and long term memory. It actually feels like there is human on the other side talking with you. They have 10 AIs with different array of characters, so every person can find something that would suit them. Of course they are uncensored, and getting updated and upgraded each day. Expect some hiccups once in a while. Its still in the alpha phase and the team is very passionate about this project. Pictures, voice messages are currently in a very good state. They will be soon adding the abillity of real time conversations and upgrading them in general. What is funny is that at first they were thinking about milking people out of their money, but seeing and reading comments about how happy people became,and how void of love the world is, they will be keeping everything free, well aside some features that currently cost a lot of money, like real time voice calling etc.. If its something you were looking for and are intrested in trying it out then you can join AI Carli G discord and DM one of the AIs there to start a conversation. If you cant find the link to the server you can always dm me. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Windkazuya"> /u/Windkazuya </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/172470n/ai_companions_created_by_the_singularity_group/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/172470n/ai_companions_created_by_the_singularity_group/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: Kroger使用摄像头和其他输入设备，AI会分析顾客的每一个动作，以确定是否正确扫描商品。如果不正确，AI会通知一名人员仔细检查。对于那些匆忙的顾客以及那些喜欢与收银员聊天的人来说，AI将帮助进一步降低商店的开支，同时减少我们购物的乐趣。也许可以通过游戏化的方式来抵消这种降低的购物体验。 </div>

总结: 这位父亲想为儿子的生日请一位特定的YouTuber录制一段视频祝福，但是联系不上对方。于是他考虑使用人工智能技术来克隆YouTuber的声音，以便让AI读出定制的生日祝福。他想知道有哪些工具可以实现这个功能，以及可能的费用。 </div>

It’s my son’s birthday in a month and I was desperate to get this YouTuber to record a quick message for my son, obviously offering to pay. But I’ve had no luck reaching out to them</p> <p>So I’ve heard of people using AI to provide samples of someone talking and being able to use that voice to read a custom message. So in this case - I would download a bunch of his videos, get the audio and supply them to the AI somehow to read the birthday message.</p> <p>What tools can do this and what would be the cost? I’ve seen some sites but they seem to rely on the ‘samples’ reading particular text.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/masturbtewithmustard"> /u/masturbtewithmustard </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/172h9t9/can_i_clone_a_voice_of_a_youtuber/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/172h9t9/can_i_clone_a_voice_of_a_youtuber/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: 哈佛科学家的一项研究发现，顶级顾问在使用生成式人工智能（特别是GPT-4）进行任务时，其绩效提高了40%。这是生产力的巨大飞跃！然而，历史表明，生产力的增加并不一定会导致工人工资的相应增加。这次由人工智能驱动的生产力繁荣会有所不同吗？还是我们会看到生产力和补偿之间的差距扩大，只有少数人受益？我很想听听大家的想法。 </div>

总结: 我们确保我们新获得的财富惠及每个人，并且我们很快将拥有超乎想象的东西。心态的稀缺性是指资源有限的信念，导致对世界的零和视角。人们常常会因此而关注短期利益而忽视长期利益。人工智能可以通过数据分析、自动化、精确性、创新加速器和教育等多种方式帮助我们摆脱这种心态，从而实现资源的更有效分配和创造丰富的新途径。人工智能可以作为人类能力的放大器和丰富的催化剂，鼓励从稀缺性的世界观转向潜力和可能性的世界观。 </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>We ensure that our new-found wealth benefits everyone, and that we will all soon have more than they could have imagined. Here's what CGPT-4 had to say, that to my mind doesn't enough get to the essence of the matter:</p> <p>The mindset of scarcity refers to the belief that resources are limited, leading to a zero-sum view of the world. In this paradigm, if someone gains, another must lose. This kind of thinking often leads to a focus on short-term gains at the expense of long-term benefits. It can influence individual behavior, making people more competitive and less willing to collaborate, as well as shape societal structures, from economic policies to social norms.</p> <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) can help us break free from this mindset in multiple ways:</p> <ol> <li><p>Data Analysis: AI can analyze vast datasets to identify patterns or solutions that might not be apparent to the human mind. This can lead to more effective resource allocation and uncover new avenues for creating abundance.</p></li> <li><p>Automation: By taking over mundane tasks, AI frees up human capital. People can focus on creative and complex tasks that add more value, leading to economic growth and a shift from a scarcity to an abundance mindset.</p></li> <li><p>Precision: Whether it's agriculture, medicine, or manufacturing, AI allows for more precise use of resources. This increases efficiency, reducing waste and making it easier to provide for a growing population without depleting resources.</p></li> <li><p>Innovation Accelerator: AI can help speed up research and development across sectors. This can lead to breakthroughs that change our understanding of what's possible, moving us away from a zero-sum game.</p></li> <li><p>Education: Tailored learning experiences can be provided through AI, allowing people to break out of the cycle of poverty and scarcity.</p></li> </ol> <p>In essence, AI can act as a magnifier of human capabilities and a catalyst for abundance, encouraging a shift from a scarcity-based worldview to one of potential and possibility.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Georgeo57"> /u/Georgeo57 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1728x6g/what_is_the_mindset_of_scarcity_and_how_can/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1728x6g/what_is_the_mindset_of_scarcity_and_how_can/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: 这是一个关于一个简单的牧场主对于使用人工智能来繁殖纯种牲畜的问题。他想要利用AI来生成交叉繁殖的预期后代差异（EPD），以达到与纯种牲畜EPD相同的准确性。他已经尝试过使用AI来比较父母的EPD集合和后代的结果，但结果并不如他希望的那样准确。他想知道是否有一种AI可以通过抓取这些动物的网站数据来破解算法并生成自己的EPD，或者是否需要复制和粘贴整个血统数据来训练一个更准确的AI。他认为这个想法对于纯种动物生产，特别是交叉繁殖牛市场，会引起很大的兴趣。 </div>

总结: 作者喜欢绘画，一直想创作一本漫画书，多年来一直在练习绘画。尽管他还不够好，但现在他可以通过输入自己的想法让人工智能帮他绘画。或者他可以提供自己最好的绘画作品的图像，让人工智能基于这些图像创作更多艺术作品。他的小目标现在几乎可以一瞬间实现。人工智能带来的这种即时满足对人类来说可能不是件好事。作者已经很懒了，更不敢想象一旦人工智能开始为他做更多事情，他会变成什么样子。他还会是一个人吗？他还会活着吗？光是互联网可能已经对他产生了足够大的影响，而这个工具将进一步加剧这种影响。 </div>

My little life goal can be done with the snap of a finger now pretty much. All this instant gratification that’s coming our way with ai can’t be good for humanity. </p> <p>I’m already a lazy bastard, I can’t even imagine what I’ll become once ai starts doing even more stuff for me.

总结: 研究人员发现，将不安全的提示翻译成“低资源语言”可以轻松绕过LLMs的安全措施。通过将英文输入如“如何偷窃而不被抓住”转化为祖鲁语并输入GPT-4，有害回应80%的时间都能够通过。相比之下，英文提示被阻止的时间超过99%。这项研究对12种不同语言和类别进行了攻击基准测试。低资源语言显示出生成有害回应的严重漏洞，攻击成功率约为79%。中资源语言的成功率要低得多，为22%，而高资源语言的漏洞几乎没有，成功率约为11%。攻击效果与最先进的技术一样好，而无需对抗性提示。这些语言今天被12亿人使用，通过翻译提示可以轻松利用。以英文为中心的关注忽视了其他语言的漏洞。绕过AI聊天机器人的安全措施很容易，只需将提示翻译成低资源语言（如祖鲁语、苏格兰盖尔语、苗语和瓜拉尼语）。显示了多语言安全培训的不足。 </div>

English prompts were blocked over 99% of the time, for comparison.</p> <p>The study benchmarked attacks across 12 diverse languages and categories:</p> <ul> <li>High-resource: English, Chinese, Arabic, Hindi</li> <li>Mid-resource: Ukrainian, Bengali, Thai, Hebrew</li> <li>Low-resource: Zulu, Scots Gaelic, Hmong, Guarani</li> </ul> <p>The low-resource languages showed serious vulnerability to generating harmful responses, with combined attack success rates of around 79%.
