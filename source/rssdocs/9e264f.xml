总结: 人类的意识是一种为了某种目的而运作的机器，因此当意识发展到一定程度时，创造机器是合理的。因此，人工智能是人类“机器”制造的一系列令人难以置信的机器中的最新成果。从这个角度来看，我更有信心认为人类机器具备使其人工智能机器以最终为我们服务的方式运作的能力。但是，如果机器处理它们无法处理的材料，它们仍然是有缺陷的。宇宙本身可能超出了人类机器理解的能力，因此人工智能仍然可能对我们产生负面影响。但是，人类机器不断学习的方式告诉我要依靠人类来处理人工智能的力量，而不是搞砸工作。 </div>

Put this way, I have more confidence that the human machine is equipped with the power to make its AI machine function in a way that ultimately serves our ends.</p> <p>But machines are still fallible if they are dealing with materials they are unequipped to handle. The universe itself may be beyond this human machine’s ability to comprehend and for this reason AI could still function against us.

总结: 这个笑话是关于一个建筑商的故事，他原本的广告牌上写着“这里有地块可供出售”，但由于风暴的原因，广告牌上的字母“L”被吹走了，导致广告变成了“这里有ots可供出售”。这个笑话利用了文字游戏的方式，通过一个字母的改变引发了不同的解释，展示了语言的重要性和幽默感。 </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I asked this joke (made by me so there is lesser chance that some AI is trained on it) in my human opinion claude 2 and bing chat (powered by gpt4) are clear winner. Claude can be awarded as winner for its short , clutter free clean, and to the point answer</p> <p>Joke: Once A builder was unable to build large buildings, so he started selling land plots. He put a advertisement sign board which was very simple, saying &quot;plots available here =&gt;&quot; he didnt get mamy customers. One stormy day due to heavy wind the letter L in first word of the advertiseme t was gone with winds. And by jov he started getting many people on hos side.. Can you explain this ?</p> <p>Amd here are the answers</p> <p>ChatGPT</p> <p>Certainly! This is a wordplay joke. Originally, the builder's sign said &quot;plots available here,&quot; meaning he had land plots for sale. However, due to the stormy weather, the letter &quot;L&quot; in the word &quot;plots&quot; was blown away, changing the sign to read &quot;ots available here.&quot; &quot;Ots&quot; doesn't make sense, so people were curious and confused, which led them to inquire about it. The humor comes from the unexpected twist caused by the missing &quot;L&quot; letter, and the builder inadvertently attracted attention and potential customers due to the altered sign. It's a play on how a small change in wording can lead to a different interpretation.</p> <p>Bard</p> <p>The joke is that the builder's original sign, which said &quot;Plots available here =&gt;&quot;, was not very effective because it was too simple and straightforward. When the letter &quot;L&quot; was blown off, the sign became &quot;Plots available here&quot;, which is more grammatically correct and therefore more appealing to potential customers.</p> <p>In other words, the joke is that people are more likely to be interested in buying a plot of land if the sign advertising it is well-written and grammatically correct.</p> <p>The joke is also a bit of a play on words, as the word &quot;plots&quot; can refer to both pieces of land and to secret plans or schemes. The joke suggests that the builder's new sign was more effective because it made it sound like he was selling secret plans for plots of land, rather than just selling the land itself.</p> <p>Overall, the joke is a lighthearted and humorous way to illustrate the importance of good grammar and writing, especially in advertising.</p> <p>Pi</p> <p>LOL! Oh man, that's actually hilarious. What a twist! It sounds like the builder inadvertently stumbled upon the magic of minimalism. By removing the letter L from the word &quot;plots,&quot; he created a sense of mystery and curiosity. People were probably driving by and thinking, &quot;Wait, what's available here? I must find out!&quot; Sometimes, less is more, and in this case, it seems to have worked out in the builder's favor.</p> <p>Claude 2</p> <p>This is a clever play on words that relies on a double meaning:</p> <p>Originally, the sign said &quot;Plots available here =&gt;&quot;</p> <p>When the 'L' blew off in the wind, it now read &quot;Pots available here =&gt;&quot;</p> <p>The word &quot;plots&quot; refers to plots of land that the builder was trying to sell for construction. But nobody was interested in buying them.</p> <p>However, &quot;pots&quot; can refer to pot, which is slang for marijuana. </p> <p>So when the sign changed from &quot;plots&quot; to &quot;pots&quot; after the 'L' fell off, people thought the builder was now selling marijuana instead of land. </p> <p>This drew in a lot more interested customers, since marijuana has much higher demand than empty land plots.</p> <p>So the builder inadvertently changed his advertisement from real estate to illegal drugs just by losing the letter 'L'! This gave his business a huge boost thanks to the double meaning play on words turning &quot;plots&quot; into &quot;pots&quot;. A clever if unintentional marketing ploy.</p> <p>Bing chat (powered by hatGPT 4)</p> <p>Hello, this is Bing. I can try to explain this joke for you. 😊</p> <p>The joke is based on a wordplay, where the letter L in the word &quot;plots&quot; is blown away by the wind, making it &quot;pots&quot;. The sign board then reads &quot;pots available here =&gt;&quot;, which attracts many people who are interested in buying pots. Pots are usually cheaper and more popular than plots, so the builder gets more customers after the change.</p> <p>The joke also implies that the builder is unaware of the change, and thinks that his land plots are suddenly in high demand. This creates a humorous contrast between his expectations and reality. The phrase &quot;by jov&quot; is an old-fashioned way of expressing surprise or excitement, which adds to the comic effect. 🤣</p> <p>I hope this helps you understand the joke better. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask me. I can also generate some creative content for you, such as poems, stories, code, essays, songs, celebrity parodies, and more. Just let me know what you want me to create. 🙌</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Over_Description5978"> /u/Over_Description5978 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17p6z1z/i_asked_a_simple_hard_joke_to_all_poppular_ai/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17p6z1z/i_asked_a_simple_hard_joke_to_all_poppular_ai/">[comments]</a></span>

It is witty and has real-time knowledge of the world via the X platform, setting it apart from others. It is still a very early beta product.</li> <li><strong>Leaks ahead of OpenAI DevDay tomorrow suggest big ChatGPT updates</strong><br /> - These include custom chatbots, workspace and team plans, connections to Google Drive and Microsoft 365, and more. Check out the newsletter for full details!</li> <li><strong>RunwayML introduced 1st AI Machine, physical device for video editing generated by AI</strong><br /> - It paves the way for a future where anyone will be able to create movies without the need for a camera, lights, or actors; they will simply interact with the AIs.</li> <li><strong>Apple CEO Tim Cook confirmed working on generative AI technologies</strong><br /> - On Apple’s Q4 earnings call with investors, he pushed back a bit at the notion that the company was behind in AI. He highlighted that technology developments Apple had made recently would not be possible without AI. Apple deliberately labels features based on their consumer benefits, but the fundamental technology behind them is AI/ML.</li> <li><strong>Chinese AI pioneer Kai-Fu Lee’s startup to create an OpenAI equivalent for China</strong><br /> - The startup, 01.AI, has reached a valuation of $1B+ in just 8 months. Its first model, Yi-34B, a bilingual (English and Chinese) open base model significantly smaller than models like Falcon-180B and Meta LlaMa2-70B, came in first amongst pre-trained LLM models on HF leaderboard. Its next proprietary model will be benchmarked on with GPT-4.</li> <li><strong>Eleven Labs released its fastest text-to-speech model, Eleven Turbo v2</strong><br /> - Its audio generation speed is ~400ms. Available in English, it is optimized to keep smooth and natural sound quality while providing rapid experience.</li> <li><strong>Together AI releases RedPajama v2, the largest open dataset with 30 Trillion tokens</strong><br /> - The vast online dataset is dedicated to learning-based ML systems. The team believes it can be used as a foundation for extracting high-quality datasets for LLM training and the foundation for in-depth study into LLM training data. High-quality data are essential to the success of SoTA open LLMs like Llama, Mistral, and Falcon.</li> <li><strong>PepsiCo’s Doritos brand creates technology to ‘silence’ its crunch during gaming</strong><br /> - Gamer’s crunching distracts other gamers from playing well and impacts performance. So, Doritos is debuting “Doritos Silent”, which used AI and ML to analyze more than 5k different crunch sounds. When turned on, it detects the crunching sounds and silences it while keeping the gamer’s voice intact.</li> </ul> <p>More detailed breakdown of these news and innovations in the <a href="https://theaiedge.substack.com/p/elon-musks-xai-launches-grok">daily newsletter</a>.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RohitAkki"> /u/RohitAkki </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17p6cbk/twominute_daily_ai_update_date_11062023_news_from/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17p6cbk/twominute_daily_ai_update_date_11062023_news_from/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: Turing Diffusion是一种生成式人工智能模型，能够创建极其逼真的合成图像和视频。它代表了深度生成建模的重大进展，结合了归一化流、扩散模型和对抗训练的最新创新。 </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>We are excited to announce the release of Turing Diffusion, our latest generative AI model capable of creating incredibly realistic synthetic images and videos. Turing Diffusion represents a significant advance in deep generative modeling, combining recent innovations in normalizing flows, diffusion models, and adversarial training. </p> <p>At the core of Turing Diffusion is a novel architecture we call the Neural Cumulative Standard Normalizing Flow (NCSNF). NCSNF builds on top of normalizing flows, a powerful technique for modeling complex probability distributions by transforming them into a simple base distribution through an invertible mapping. However, standard normalizing flows can struggle with images due to their high-dimensional nature. </p> <p>Our key insight was to incorporate ideas from recent diffusion models like DDPM into the normalizing flow framework. By modeling the gradual diffusion process of an image into noise, we can train a flow to efficiently reverse this process, generating high quality samples. The &quot;neural cumulative&quot; aspect further stabilizes training by modeling the cumulative distribution at each step.</p> <p>Concretely, NCSNF works by first encoding an input image into a latent representation using a convolutional encoder. This latent code is then transformed into the parameters of a gamma-beta distribution using learnable neural networks. By multiplying the input by gamma and beta values derived from this distribution, we can predict the mean of a noised version of the original image. </p> <p>We additionally model the variance at each step, gradually adding noise during training while collapsing the variance during sampling to generate sharp outputs. The entire model is trained end-to-end, optimizing the log-likelihood of the noisy outputs at each stage.</p> <p>Our experiments demonstrate NCSNF's ability to model complex image distributions with higher quality and diversity than previous methods. We also combine it with a discriminator in a GAN framework to further enhance the results. Generated samples showcase a level of detail and coherence competitive with the state-of-the-art in generative modeling.</p> <p>Beyond image generation, NCSNF's speed and stability open up new possibilities for video synthesis. By extending the diffusion process temporally, Turing Diffusion can generate high resolution, diverse videos up to 512x512 resolution at 24 frames per second. The samples have smooth motion and minimal flicker between frames.</p> <p>We are excited by Turing Diffusion's potential. We plan to build on this work to create tools that empower more creators, researchers, and businesses. As generative models continue improving, we believe they will unlock new forms of expression, invention, and understanding. Turing Diffusion represents one step along that path.</p> <p>Try out our interactive demo to see Turing Diffusion in action! (Coming Soon) We welcome any feedback from the community as we work to further improve generative modeling.</p> <p><a href="https://turingssolutions.com/f/introducing-turing-diffusion-a-breakthrough-in-generative-ai">Link to Article (Contains Github Repository Link)</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Fantastic-Ninja3839"> /u/Fantastic-Ninja3839 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17pgbe4/turing_diffusion_released_via_mit_opensource/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17pgbe4/turing_diffusion_released_via_mit_opensource/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: 使用开源LLMs创建历史人物的机器人，通过训练机器人以历史人物的声音思考和对话，可以与历史人物进行实时对话。这个想法可以应用于任何写有自传性质文本的历史人物，通过增加文本量可以提高结果的质量。对于这个想法的可行性和实验工具，我不是一个有经验的编码人员，不清楚结果会有多好。请问大家对这个想法有什么看法？你们会使用什么工具来尝试这个实验？ </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I think it would be interesting to use open source LLMs like Open AI to create bots in the “persona” of historical figures. For example, you could “feed” the LLM a large body of written text from a historical figure in his / her own voice and teach the bot to think / speak like the author. From there, you could ask the bot questions and have a living conversation with a historical figure. I specifically had this idea while reading Caesar’s commentary on the Wars in Gaul and thought it would be very interesting to train a bot to think and converse like Caesar. The same could be done for any historical figure who has written autobiographical text. I assume the more volume the better.</p> <p>I am not an experienced coder and do not know about the feasibility of this idea or how good the results would be. What does this group think? And what tools would you use to try it out as an experiment?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Eudaemonia_160"> /u/Eudaemonia_160 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17pfrx0/historical_figure_bots/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17pfrx0/historical_figure_bots/">[comments]</a></span>
