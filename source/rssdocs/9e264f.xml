                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Turing's Solutions, a leading provider of AI solutions, today announced the release of AI Immunizer, an open-source code library for protecting AI models from poisoning. AI poisoning is a type of adversarial attack in which an attacker attempts to manipulate the training data of an AI model in order to cause it to make incorrect predictions.</p> <p>AI Immunizer works by first identifying labels that are likely to be poisoned. It then corrects these labels using a variety of techniques, such as majority voting or averaging.</p> <p>AI Immunizer has been shown to be effective in protecting a variety of image models from AI poisoning. The AI Immunizer code is released under an MIT Open Source license. This means that anyone can use, modify, and distribute the code freely.</p> <p>How to use AI Immunizer</p> <p>To use AI Immunizer, you first need to train a machine learning model to predict the probability that a label is poisoned. You can do this using any machine learning algorithm, such as logistic regression or random forest.</p> <p>Once you have trained a model, you can use AI Immunizer to protect your AI model from poisoning. To do this, simply pass the training data to the AI Immunizer library. AI Immunizer will then identify and correct any poisoned labels.</p> <p>Benefits of using AI Immunizer</p> <p>There are several benefits to using AI Immunizer:</p> <p>It is effective in protecting a variety of AI models from AI poisoning.</p> <p>It is easy to use.</p> <p>It is open source and freely available.</p> <p>Conclusion</p> <p>The AI Immunizer code library is a valuable tool for anyone who is developing or using AI models. It can help to protect AI models from AI poisoning and improve their accuracy.</p> <p>About Turing's Solutions</p> <p>Turing's Solutions is a leading provider of AI solutions. The company offers a variety of products and services, including AI consulting, AI development, and AI training. Turing's Solutions is committed to helping businesses leverage AI to improve their operations and achieve their goals. </p> <p>Article and Github repository can be found <a href="https://turingssolutions.com/f/ai-immunizer-code-to-protect-ai-models-from-poisoning">from here</a>. </p> <p>The repository is a Python module that implements an algorithm to detect and correct biases in labelled data, based on the research paper &quot;FAIRLABEL: Correcting Bias in Labels&quot; by Srinivasan H Sengamedu and Hien Pham from Amazon.</p> <p>The module defines a class called FAIRLABEL, which takes the data, labels, and groups as input, and trains a machine learning model to predict the probability that a label is poisoned. The class also provides methods to detect and correct the poisoned labels using various techniques, such as majority voting or averaging.</p> <p>The module also includes a function called get_bootstrap_confidence, which estimates the confidence interval for the false positive rate (FPR) using the bootstrap method. The function takes the FPR function, the probabilities, the threshold, the alpha level, and the number of bootstrap samples as input, and returns the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Fantastic-Ninja3839"> /u/Fantastic-Ninja3839 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17ojpb0/mit_open_source_release_ai_immunizer_code_to/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17ojpb0/mit_open_source_release_ai_immunizer_code_to/">[comments]</a></span>

I mostly work on applicability of R&amp;D to taxation and I have 40 years experience as a software engineer. </p> <p>My take on AI so far in my research is that there are 1) companys that create the tools 2) there are users of those tools. </p> <p>The creators write the tools in standard programming languages. These tools help to collect and organize data. </p> <p>The users use the tools created to train models with the data. </p> <p>My thought is that the tool creators are writing an app and the users are using the app to organize and to report on the data collected. This might have tax implications. I need to figure this out. </p> <p>I realize there are lots of efforts by the tool creators to come up with ways to gather the data. There is also probably a large amount of effort by the user to tag the data for supervised info. The way I see it the user gathers the data, the tool organizes the data, the user then uses the tool to create a system that can 'report' on the data.</p> <p>Am I missing something(s) here?

I'm not the most experienced programmer, so I need things to be kept simple, if possible.</p> <p>I'm wondering.. 1. What kind of software or tools do I need to build Aila? I'm a bit lost here. I'm currently using Cody AI with GPT-3.5 turbo but its not perfect. 2. Are there any good online courses or tutorials for a beginner like me? Something simple and easy to understand would be perfect. 3. How can I make Aila talk and sound friendly, like a real person with rich personality? I want her to be approachable and nice. I tried deferent prompts but I cant make her get out of the customer support chatbot role. 4. Any advice on making Aila understand emotions and have a sense of humor? I want her to be able to connect with people. 5. I have this dream of Aila tweeting and posting photos on her own. It sounds ambitious, but I'm hopeful. 6. What are some cool features I can add to make Aila more fun and engaging for users? Any ideas? 7. Initially, I want to run Aila for free. cause currently there's no way for me to make any money off her.</p> <p>I'd really appreciate any advice or tips you guys can give me.

<br>
<br>
总结: 一位CPA对于构建一个洗钱交易软件程序感兴趣，并且想知道是否适合使用人工智能技术。该工具将导入多个Excel文件，详细说明全年的销售情况和年底持有的证券。对于每一笔导致亏损的销售，该工具需要在两份报告中搜索在销售日期之前或之后30天内获得的与所售证券实质上相似的证券。对于在此期间进行的任何收购，该工具将暂停亏损并将其添加到所收购证券的成本基础上，同时还包括所售证券的持有期。一旦出售了这种新证券，分析就会再次进行，亏损和持有期将被转移到新证券上，或者允许作为销售继续存在。还有一件事我应该补充的是，实质上相似包括该工具必须识别出期权的基础证券与其搜索的证券相同，并且输入报告通常以不同的方式格式化期权的披露。例如，对于GE股票的期权，可能会说OPT_GE或某种变体。我通过上传样本报告，解释洗钱交易规则，并要求Chat GPT运行显示已识别的洗钱交易的分析来进行了测试。它生成了一个实际完成了这个任务的Excel文件。所以我想知道它是如何做到的？它在幕后使用了Python吗？在构建我的洗钱交易工具时，是否有意义通过API整合人工智能的能力？或者这不是人工智能的一个好的使用案例？谢谢您的时间。 </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, CPA here. I’m interested in building a wash sale software program and am wondering if AI technology would be appropriate.</p> <p>Basically the tool would ingest multiple Excel files detailing sales throughout the year and securities held at year end. For every sale that resulted in a loss, the tool would have to search both reports for an acquisition of a substantially similar security to the one that was sold either 30 days before or after the sale date. For any acquisitions made during this window, the tool would suspend the loss and add it to the cost basis of the acquired security, along with the holding period of the sold security. Once this new security is sold, the analysis is done again and the loss and holding period are either moved to the new security or allowed to be sustained as a sale. One more thing I should add is that substantially similar includes options on the security, so the tool has to recognize when an option’s underlying security is the same as the one it’s searching for, and the input reports often format the disclosure of options differently. For example, for an option on GE stock, it might say OPT_GE, or some variation. </p> <p>I ran a test with GPT 4 by uploading the sample reports, explaining the wash sale rules, and asking it to run an analysis showing wash sales identified. It spit out an Excel that actually did this.</p> <p>So I’m wondering how did it do this? Did it use Python behind the scenes? In building my wash sale tool, would it make sense to incorporate AI’s abilities through API? Or is this not a good use case for AI?</p> <p>Thank you for your time.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Doggo_9000"> /u/Doggo_9000 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17o8jem/use_case_for_ai/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17o8jem/use_case_for_ai/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: 政治吸引了我们中最糟糕的一部分。它是自恋者和被骄傲和贪婪驱使的人的磁铁。即使有善意的人设法进入政治权力的位置，最终他们也会变得腐败或开始懈怠。结论是什么？人类不适合从事政治 - 人类不适合管理公共事务和行使给予政治家的权力。解决方案是什么？让国家和公共事务由不受人类人格障碍、自恋、人类贪婪和自负影响的东西来管理。这个东西只是执行其所述的功能 - 管理国家和公共事务。解决方案是利用人工智能来实现这个功能。我们如何确保人工智能不会被特殊利益集团或其他恶意人士攻击或颠覆？我们通过基于区块链技术的人工智能源代码来确保。每个公民都会收到一份区块链的副本，并通过它行使他们的民主权利来指导或修改国家管理的人工智能。如果你对区块链技术不熟悉，我建议你了解一下。它基本上是一个无法被黑客攻击的数据结构，只能通过多数同意 - 即民主投票来修改。但是，姐妹们和兄弟们，请注意，那些掌权者将在允许自己被基于区块链的人工智能取代之前与我们进行顽强的斗争。 </div>

Even when someone of good intentions somehow manages to get into a position of power in politics, eventually they become corrupted or start to slack off.<br /> The conclusion? Humans are not fit for politics - humans are not fit to administer public affairs and wield the power that is given to politicians.<br /> What is the solution? To have the state and public affairs administered by something that is not subject to human personality disorders, narcissism, human greed and an inflated ego. Something which simply performs its stated function - to administer the state and public affairs. The solution is to use artificial intelligence for this function.<br /> How can we ensure that the AIs don't become hacked or subverted by special interest groups or other malevolent humans? We ensure it by basing the source code of the AIs on blockchain technology. Every citizen receives one copy of the blockchain, and through it exercises their democratic right to direct or modify the state-administering-AI. If you're not familiar with blockchain technology I recommend you learn about it. It's basically an un-hackable data structure that can only be modified by majority agreement - i.e. by a democratic vote.<br /> But be warned sisters and brothers, those in power will fight us tooth and nail before they allow themselves to be replaced by blockchain-based AI.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/__The__Anomaly__"> /u/__The__Anomaly__ </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17oeek8/we_need_to_replace_politicians_with/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17oeek8/we_need_to_replace_politicians_with/">[comments]</a></span>
