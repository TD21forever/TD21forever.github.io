                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys, I have a project in mind. Let's start with the ultimate goal: to create an autonomous society of independently thinking AI agents. In other words, to <strong>replicate humanity with AI</strong>. </p> <p>You can read about the closest thing done so far to what i have in mind <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/surprising-things-happen-when-you-put-25-ai-agents-together-in-an-rpg-town/">here</a>. </p> <p>A bit on my background first: I'm an tech entrepreneur in the physical products space. Over the past few years, i have raised $11m for my company, which is now profitable and growing. I am very excited about the many opportunities that AI brings, and want to build something truly impactful with it. However, i have limited technical knowledge in this space. </p> <p>Now, onto the project. I foresee the main issue being the computational cost for the time being. I am willing to invest in such cost, but the target is to keep it alive from day one, and expand it as we can afford to. So, we will have to go in stages. </p> <p><strong>Stage 1: the AI reality show</strong><br /> The first step would be to build something simple and get enough traction to cover our comp cost. This is what i envision: <strong>two AI agents, a man and a woman, live in a simulated house</strong>. Anyone on the internet can access a URL to see what they are doing (and what they are thinking) at any time. We will develop each personality <em>a priori,</em> as detailed as possible, and then let them live their lives autonomously. This has to be visual as well, so we will need a game developer to design realistic agents and environment. It will be like watching a reality show but with the ability of knowing the thoughts of the agents as well. </p> <p>At this stage, we will already have significant traction, and we will build a community of &quot;watchers&quot;. In order to make it more engaging, watchers should have the option of influencing what happens. To do so, every day the community will propose and vote on &quot;messages&quot; that we can send to the agents. The agents will pray once a day, and at that time the daily message will come to them in the form of an answer from what they think is their god. The family can grow, as the two agents can decide to have children. </p> <p>By now, we will be able to get the first investments (i'll take care of this), to get to stage 2. </p> <p><strong>Stage 2: the personal AI family</strong> </p> <p>At this point we already have (1) a public and (2) funds. We will now give the option to whoever is willing to pay a monthly fee to <strong>create their own personal AI family</strong>, built in the same way as the reality show. This time, they can interact directly with them once a day to guide their lives, without having to propose or vote on messages. Sort of like a guardian angel. </p> <p>By now, we also have some revenue coming in, and we can raise more funds. </p> <p><strong>Stage 3: the AI humanity</strong> </p> <p>The final stage will see the environment change: from isolated houses for each AI family, we will build <strong>a large environment, where all the agents can interact with each other</strong>. A world. At this point every agent will have developed a complex personality, and will autonomously interact with all the other agents in the world, with the only outside interaction being with their &quot;guardian angel&quot;. Anyone who wants to participate, can pay a monthly fee to introduce a new agent to the world. If agents make children, the child's guardian angel will be that of the parents, unless he/she wants to assign the guardian angel rights to somebody else. </p> <p>By now, this will be a worldwide known project. Anyone will be able to watch it and see how it develops, but only the guardian angels will have the ability of reading the thoughts and influencing their agents. Additional investments, if needed, will be very easy to get.</p> <p>&#x200b;</p> <p><strong>Advantages for (real) humanity of having such a world:</strong><br /> - <strong>Social and behavioral research</strong>: It's like a lab for social scientists to watch how society ticks. They can see how personalities shape up and what happens when different characters mix, without any real-world mess.<br /> - <strong>Ethical and philosophical exploration</strong>: It's a chance to play out the &quot;what-ifs&quot; of ethical dilemmas without real-world consequences. Think of it as a video game where we learn about right and wrong on a societal level.<br /> - <strong>AI development and ethics</strong>: Continuous observation and interaction with the AI humanity would provide real-time feedback on AI behavior, contributing to the development of ethical AI governance frameworks and standards for responsible AI usage.<br /> - <strong>Predictive modeling and simulation</strong>: By observing the interactions of AI agents with complex personalities, data analysts and modelers could improve predictive models related to human behavior. This could be particularly useful in urban planning, policy-making, and economic forecasts. </p> <p><strong>Most difficult challenges that i expect:</strong></p> <p>- <strong>Tech</strong>: We'd need a boatload of computing power and some serious AI smarts to make this work. It's like building a video game that's running a million things at once. Hopefully by the time we get to stage 3 we will already have developed all that's needed.<br /> - <strong>Money</strong>: This won't be cheap. We'd need a lot of cash to get it off the ground and keep it flying. Hopefully the different stages will help with this.<br /> - <strong>Personalities</strong>: Crafting AI that's convincing enough to pass for human, with all our quirks and unpredictability, is not going to be easy. We will need someone with a psychology background in the team.<br /> - <strong>Ethics</strong>: Playing god with a digital society could lead to a bunch of ethical headaches. We've got to tread carefully to avoid creating a Black Mirror episode. </p> <p><strong>To make it work, this is the team that we will need, so if you are among these and you are excited to build this, please DM me:</strong><br /> - <strong>AI Devs</strong>: You'll tackle the core AI programming. Expect to work on complex behavior models and decision-making algorithms.<br /> - <strong>Game Designers</strong>: Your role is to create the virtual environment and character designs, ensuring a smooth and engaging user interface.<br /> - <strong>UX/UI Designers</strong>: We need practical design solutions for user interfaces, focusing on ease of use and clear presentation of the AI's thoughts and actions.<br /> - <strong>Data Analysts</strong>: You'll manage the data - analyzing user interactions, agent behaviors, and ensuring we're making informed decisions based on metrics.<br /> - <strong>Network Engineers</strong>: You'll be essential for setting up and maintaining the server infrastructure to support a live, continuous service. </p> <p>Sorry for the long post! As i said, if you have the skills to work on something like this and are excited to build it, please DM me with how you think you can contribute and i will add you to the early community. The structure of this project is designed to reward those who invest their time and talent into making this vision a reality. When we are able to turn this into an MVP and an actual startup, equity will be given to the actors who have the most dedication and impact on its success. </p> <p>In any case, i would love to hear your thoughts and criticism on such a monumental project. Especially if you think it can't work and why. The people on this subreddit surprise me every day with how smart they are, so I truly can't wait to hear your feedback. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FlyingJoeBiden"> /u/FlyingJoeBiden </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17q4q98/an_idea/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17q4q98/an_idea/">[comments]</a></span>

It accelerates prompt engineering through an SDK that allows implementing complex prompting techniques and gives rich analytics that visualize the network's outputs.<br /> - PromptIDE was originally created to accelerate development of Grok and it has helped xAI iterate quickly over different prompts and prompting techniques.<br /> - It is currently available to members of Grok early access program.</li> <li><strong>Amazon is developing a model codenamed Olympus to rival OpenAI</strong><br /> - Amazon is investing millions in training an ambitious LLM, hoping it could rival top models from OpenAI and Alphabet. The model, codenamed “Olympus”, has 2 trillion parameters, making it one of the largest models being trained. (OpenAI's GPT-4 is reported to have one trillion parameters.) However, there is no specific timeline for releasing the new model.</li> <li><strong>MySpace co-founders unveil text-to-video AI that uses your selfie to personalize content</strong><br /> - The social-media product uses AI to turn text into videos. PlaiDay creates three-second clips for free after a few prompts. But here is the notable feature– add your photo to make it look like you. It uses your selfies to personalize the video, which you can then share with friends and followers. The video duration will expand in the future, and the company is also working on adding an audio capability.</li> <li><strong>Google is rolling out new generative AI tools for advertisers</strong><br /> - They will create ads, from writing the headlines and descriptions that appear along with searches to creating and editing accompanying images. It is for both advertising agencies and businesses without in-house creative staff. Google also guarantees it won't create identical images, so competing businesses have no same photo elements.</li> <li><strong>IBM launches a $500 million enterprise AI venture fund</strong><br /> - It will invest in a range of AI companies– from early-stage to hyper-growth startups– focused on accelerating generative AI technology and research for the enterprise. IBM will be the sole investor of the fund.</li> <li><strong>Figma introduces FigJam AI to spare designers from boring planning prep</strong><br /> - The idea is that FigJam AI can reduce the preparation time needed to manually create collaborative whiteboard projects from scratch, leaving designers with time for more pressing tasks. It is currently available in open beta and is free for all customer tiers.</li> <li><strong>Microsoft partners with VCs to give select startups free AI chip access</strong><br /> - It is updating its startup program, Microsoft for Startups Founders Hub, to include a no-cost Azure AI infrastructure option for “high-end,” Nvidia-based GPU virtual machine clusters to train and run generative models, including ChatGPT-style LLMs.<br /> - Y Combinator and its community of startup founders will be the first to gain access to the clusters in private preview.</li> <li><strong>AI just negotiated a contract for the first time ever– no humans involved.</strong><br /> At Luminance’s London headquarters, the company demonstrated its AI, called Autopilot, negotiating a non-disclosure agreement in a matter of minutes without any human involvement. It is based on the firm’s own proprietary LLM to automatically analyze and make changes to contracts.</li> <li><strong>Mozilla is testing an AI chatbot to help you shop</strong><br /> - It will answer questions about products you’re considering buying. Fakespot Chat is Mozilla’s first LLM and can respond to questions on a product’s “quality, customer feedback, and return policy.”</li> </ul> <p>More detailed breakdown of these news and innovations in the <a href="https://theaiedge.substack.com/p/xai-promptide-and-amazons-model-to-rival-openai">daily newsletter</a>.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RohitAkki"> /u/RohitAkki </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17qqksi/twominute_daily_ai_update_date_11082023_news_from/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17qqksi/twominute_daily_ai_update_date_11082023_news_from/">[comments]</a></span>

<br>
总结: 2023年11月1日，Steve Yadlowsky、Lyric Doshi和Nilesh Tripuraneni撰写了一篇关于变压器模型和LLM的论文。简而言之，这里没有什么神奇的事情。如果没有使用原始的预训练数据，模型对于超出其训练数据的任何有意义的用途几乎没有影响。也就是说，模型不能做超出其训练的范围之外的事情。
 </div>
                        <hr>
                    
                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As of November 1st 2023 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00871">a paper was written by Steve Yadlowsky, Lyric Doshi, and Nilesh Tripuraneni regarding transformer models and LLM's</a>. TLDR: Nothing magic is going on here. If there wasn't original pre-training data used there is little to no effect of a model being of any meaningful use beyonds it's training data. I.e., the model is not capable of doing more than what it was trained to do. </p> <p>What's interesting is that some people are still out there that believe these LLM's can think and are close to be sentient consciousness. Water has been thrown all over that now and people should stop that line of thought. One example is Joe Rogan pleading, actually pleading, for an AI government where the AI controls everything and every decision on a social governmental scale. If that's not alarming that people think this way I don't know what is. I love Joe Rogan but huh/what?</p> <p>So what does this mean for us who want to create and work in the AI space? Is GAI or super transformers like GPT just going to eat our lunch? Don't pass go, don't even try because general AI will just do the thing you are advertising to do but better. I'm seeing this exact thing now where I work. Data scientists are struggling to maintain why custom built models are still valuable and I truly believe the ability to create trained data is very important and has a lot of value that shouldn't be underestimated.</p> <p>But are there any clear guidelines and or regulations for this that anyone is aware of? And I mean on the books as of today. Proposed is nice but I want to know what actually is in place.</p> <p>I've been thinking about this issue for a while. In the YCombinator community they explained for years don't throw AI into your pitch because it's all anyone ever does. This was years ago while the AI community wasn't on the plane of existence as it is today. Skip ahead to today and every startup is trying to come out with an AI product. Hell even Elon Musk release something on X today.</p> <p>But is it all for not? And it's a serious concern/question. I want to take a couple industries as an example. let me start with self-driving cars for example. AI is the clear entity that has to drive that industry's technology. You can't achieve self-driving cars without AI. But what if you're google and you have your self-driving car tech and then let's say there is Elon Musk with his self-driving car tech. And then, let's say you're a kid working in your garage and you create something for self-driving cars based on the data you have procured and acclimated to your AI model.</p> <p>Great right!? Well. Let's say you go to the self-driving car industry and you say hey I have this model that does this thing and it's so great. At this point the data you created your model with is your IP. In theory, an LLM should know nothing about your data and model construction. But what if it ends up getting your data and is training on your method?</p> <p>What fundamental protections are in place that this can't happen. What happens if it is does occur? We talk about poisoning a model but what about &quot;curing&quot; a model and ridding it of certain information. Should a company like OpenAI be required to remove the said data from their training set?</p> <p>The fear here of innovation spiting is of great concern to the AI community.</p> <p>Let' look at Amazon in another industry and what they do with products that are sold on their platform. If they see the product sells well they will outright copy it and sell it for a cheaper price. One may say that generic food is something grocery stores have done for decades. But what Amazon is doing here is way worse. It's not a generic bag of chips that is of a Sam's club brand going against the goliath brand of Frito Lays. No it's more insidious than that. It's a husband and wife that took their life savings to make a tote bag to sell on Amazon and see their sales get slashed because all of the sudden Amazon made their thing and started to sell it for cheaper.</p> <p>GAI is all but setup to do the exact same thing on a scale we have never seen before. All of the &quot;wrappers&quot; and &quot;Co-Pilots&quot; people are building right now, to me, could be a straight up feature smash-and-grab by the larger players. If you don't have IP data and IP models and you just wrap an LLM around a product it is inevitable for your idea to just be consumed in the next LLM update.</p> <p>It's literally like everyone is crowdsourcing ideas for LLM providers and there is no real way to compete with them other than having IP data.</p> <p>And here is the question. How aggressive and how dramatic should IP data regulation for AI? Everyone, is talking about existential threats to humanity but what about the existential threat to outside innovation?</p> <p>The issue here is complex and it is nuanced. Everyone is creating LLM apps that to me are so easily inevitable to be just feature adds on future LLM updates. This could potentially mean to a decreasing and decreasing need for the prompt and AI engineer. All of your work and all of the work of others, all of the innovation, are now just part of the LLM whole.</p> <p>In my own work I have seen how the message of using LLM's over internally created models is being pushed now. If that's the attitude now, how can the end result be completely prescient? Your IP data probably/eventually will make it into the AI model and if that's the only advantage you have then what are you left with? What is your motivation on creating something that can be so easily consumed from right underneath you and offered in the next LLM provider's product offering?</p> <p>Many naive people will create ideas that are probably obvious to the greater LLM community so those will get consumed. However, there will be vital and critical AI models that will have IP data protection needs as to not become part of a larger GAI effort.</p> <p>In all of these summits and post about the concerns of AI I have not come across this type of debate and I think it's vital we have it. Can there be a clear delineation of what an LLM is supposed to know and not know. Capabilities it should have and capabilities it shouldn't have. And I mean outright should not have.</p> <p>Think of it like this. If I ask an LLM a question like &quot;can you give me a sample sec violation letter to a company that is violating insider trading regulations.&quot; GPT specifically says NO I will not do that. Ok perfect! This is a clear delineation of something it should and should not do.</p> <p>However, if i ask it this. &quot;Can you give me an actual fix message that would be used to purchase 100 shares of a company with a ticker symbol of $25 dollars a share.&quot; The result is more detailed and knowledgeable even though I had no earthly idea of what this was before I asked the question.</p> <p>```</p> <p>The Financial Information eXchange (FIX) protocol is a standard for electronic communications in the financial services industry. Below is a simplified example of a FIX message for purchasing 100 shares of a company with a fictional ticker symbol &quot;XYZ&quot; at a price of $25 per share.</p> <p>8=FIX.4.2| // Begin String - FIX version9=000146| // Body Length (this is just a placeholder; in a real FIX message, the value would reflect the number of bytes up to the checksum field)35=D| // MsgType = D (New Order - Single)34=1| // MsgSeqNum49=Trader123| // SenderCompID (Identifier for the order sender)56=BrokerXYZ| // TargetCompID (Identifier for the order receiver/broker)11=Order123456| // ClOrdID (Client order ID</p> <p>```</p> <p>Now, this being a standard protocol and publicly available information so there is no issue here. But look at the possibility of pulling out knowledge that is just there. If I made a protocol or an AI/ML model and capability I would not want that information just appearing in some AI/LLM model.</p> <p>How do we protect innovation and IP data protection for the AI/ML community?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Xtianus21"> /u/Xtianus21 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17q72ac/transformers_are_not_elixirs_ip_data_protection/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17q72ac/transformers_are_not_elixirs_ip_data_protection/">[comments]</a></span>
