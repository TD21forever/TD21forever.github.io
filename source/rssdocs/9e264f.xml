So being a SWE, I decided to build an AI enabled reading assistant for myself and for others that might need it.</p> <p><strong>Outtloud features:</strong></p> <ul> <li>100+ AI voices in over 10 accents</li> <li>Natural sounding human-like voices</li> <li>Focus mode - enhanced reading assistant</li> <li>Translation (adding soon)</li> <li>ChatGPT integration - Integrate ChatGPT into any document for query &amp; summarization (adding soon)</li> </ul> <p>I have read feedbacks from early users and seeing how this solution have been helping people with reading difficulties read better, makes me really happy and motivated. I plan on adding more and more features, making improvements based on feedbacks.</p> <p>People have also asked me how Outtloud differs from Speechify and others: </p> <p>I have actually built Outtloud as an inspiration from Speechify 🙌. It was a great TTS app and I have used my share of it. But I have come to realized that it is lacking some core features that could really make an actual change if implemented. </p> <p>I hope Outtloud will get to where Speechify is someday and maybe even further.</p> <p>Try it out for FREE and share your feedback: <a href="https://outtloud.com">Outtloud</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/herberz"> /u/herberz </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17dua9d/ai_voice_reader_for_those_who_reads_a_lot/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17dua9d/ai_voice_reader_for_those_who_reads_a_lot/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: 在电影和节目中，我多次看到这种情况，未来主义者要么是自私的混蛋，要么是邪恶的人，威胁他人（要么奴役他们，要么将他们变成机器人）。这可能是因为这些人讨厌自己或讨厌身边的真实人，只想拥有未来的科技。所以我想我们应该放弃未来的技术，关心朋友和家人，这样地球上就不会有更多贪婪、邪恶的混蛋了。 </div>

We are outside USA though.</p> <p>4 </p> <p>Can the custom flash cards for each kid can be stored in a separate profile of Anki or similar app in my sister phone so she can at certain times engage with certain kids based on their specific custom learning material? There are around 30 children each with varying and individual learning needs.</p> <p>5</p> <p>Can chatgpt/bing also create sort of gamification or reward systems like those found in mobile games so the kids truly feel accomplished after each session?</p> <p>6 </p> <p>Free better alternate for doing this?</p> <p>I'm not very well verse in this just started looking into this very recently so specific prompts would be more appreciated which I will test, but honestly at this time any help would be so much appreciated.</p> <p>Thank you so much!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/aaatings"> /u/aaatings </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17dujp9/can_chatgpt_or_other_ai_do_this_for_autistic_kids/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17dujp9/can_chatgpt_or_other_ai_do_this_for_autistic_kids/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: 我是少数几个相信不久的将来，我们的生活、生活方式和日常活动将被人工智能有效改变的人之一。几年前，我甚至不知道什么是人工智能，也不知道它能做什么，突然之间，到处都是关于人工智能的新闻和进展。OpenAI，人工智能的教父，一直在不懈努力地将人工智能引入每个人的生活中，我想我们应该感谢Sam哈哈。人工智能的应用几乎无处不在。从教育到制造业、医疗保健、商业，基本上你转身都会有人工智能存在或正在整合人工智能。我认为我们正在进入一个新时代，我们都需要为其带来的影响做好准备。很多人对这些激进的变化和人工智能带来的一切都感到担忧。这一切都相对较新和可怕。很多人担心“人工智能末日”，害怕人工智能接管人类。也许有一天会发生，但现在更可怕的是它对经济的影响，因为越来越多的工作岗位被人工智能取代或将被取代，因为相对来说，人工智能是比人类更便宜、更快、更聪明的劳动力。无论如何，足够的抱怨/谈话/警醒了。你在采取什么措施来应对不可避免的人工智能进化？学习新技能？还是你只是随便应付？ </div>

It’s all relatively new and scary. A lot are scared about the “AI armageddon”, afraid of AI taking over humanity. </p> <p>Maybe someday, but right now, I think what’s more scaring is the effect it is about to have on the economy, as more and more jobs are being overtaken or will be overtaken by AI as it is relatively cheaper, faster, smarter labor than human.</p> <p>Anyways, enough rant/talk/wake up call.

总结: 作者是一个新手程序员，正在尝试使用palm2 api调用来解决简单的数学问题。由于有大约50,000个问题，作者正在寻找一个可以扩展的解决方案。作者知道LLMs并不适用于数学，但是他找不到任何可以理解数学问题、将其转化为数学方程并准确解决的工具。Gpt4在聊天格式中做得很好，但目前似乎有点昂贵。作者尝试了Bard聊天，它能够返回简单数学问题的解决方案（准确率为60%）。问题是当作者尝试使用palm2 api解决相同的问题时，准确率只有20%。作者的前提是：Bard基于相同的模型，虽然聊天可能会进行优化，但准确率不应该有这么大的差异。作者希望能得到关于自己可能出错的地方或者其他可以探索的方法的建议或想法。非常感谢！ </div>

Since there are about 50,000 problems, I am looking for a solution that can scale. </p> <p>I know LLMs are not built for Math but I am not able to find any tool that can understand word problems, convert it to mathematical equations and solve it accurately. Gpt4 does pretty good job on it at least in chat format but it seems bit costly as of now. I tried Bard chat and it is able to return solutions for easy word problems (say 60% accurate). </p> <p>Problem is when I try to solve the same using palm2 api, I get 20% accurate results. My premise is that: bard is based on same model and though there will be optimization for chat, but still it will not have such a wide difference in accuracy.

<br>
总结: Kadane's Sliding Window是一种用于大型语言模型的长期记忆窗口，可以解决语言模型短期记忆的限制。它可以与任何LLM模型结合使用，并且非常简单地添加到现有的模型架构中。通过使用Kadane's Sliding Window，LLM模型可以存储和访问过去的信息，即使这些信息不在当前给定的上下文中。 </div>
                        <hr>
                    
                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Yes, I am aware MemGPT exists. MemGPT is exactly why I am releasing Kadane's Sliding Window under an MIT Open-Source license. MemGPT only works with OpenAI. If you do not want to pay OpenAI money, you cannot use it. Kadane's Sliding Window is about 15 lines of Python code. You can slap this baby into whatever LLM model you would like to! </p> <p>I personally tested it out with a Phi-1.5 model. Works nice. Wrote me a nice and very long story about Alice in Wonderland. It stayed congruent with the story the entire time, because it had a context window that I fed it, that grew and grew as it spit out the story. It took about 10 seconds to set it up. </p> <p>Release Date: October 20, 2023</p> <p>License: MIT Open-Source</p> <p>Introduction</p> <p>Kadane's Sliding Window is a new long-term memory window for large language models (LLMs). It is adjustable to any length, depending on the size of the model and the limitations of the hardware. Kadane's Sliding Window is specifically designed to be used with any LLM model, and it is very simple to add to any existing model architecture.</p> <p>Motivation</p> <p>Kadane's algorithm has existed in computer science for a long time. Kadane's algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm for finding the maximum subarray of a given array. It is also particularly well-suited for tasks that involve finding patterns in sequences. It has one limitation; it is meant for unlimited arrays, but I want it for limited strings. So, 'Kadane's Sliding Window'. Ez Pz lemon squeezy.</p> <p>LLMs are powerful tools for generating text, translating languages, and answering questions in an informative way. However, they have one major limitation: they have a very short memory. This means that they can only remember the information that is contained in the context that they are given.Kadane's Sliding Window addresses this limitation by providing LLMs with a long-term memory window. This window allows LLMs to store and access information from the past, even if it is not explicitly included in the context that they are currently given.</p> <p>Implementation</p> <p>Kadane's Sliding Window is implemented as a queue. The queue is initialized with a maximum length, which is determined by the size of the model and the limitations of the hardware. As the model generates text, the tokens are added to the queue. When the queue reaches its maximum length, the oldest tokens are removed.</p> <p>To use Kadane's Sliding Window, simply add the following code to your existing LLM model architecture:</p> <p>Python</p> <p>class KadaneSlidingWindow:</p> <p>def __init__(self, maxlen):</p> <p>self.maxlen = maxlen</p> <p>self.window = collections.deque()</p> <p>def add(self, elements):</p> <p>for element in elements:</p> <p>self.window.append(element)</p> <p>if len(self.window) &gt; self.maxlen:</p> <p>self.window.popleft()</p> <p>def get_context(self):</p> <p>return &quot; &quot;.join(self.window)</p> <p># Create a Kadane Sliding Window with a maximum length of 1000 tokens</p> <p>kadane_sliding_window = KadaneSlidingWindow(maxlen=1000)</p> <p># Add the context to the sliding window</p> <p>kadane_sliding_window.add(context.split())</p> <p># Generate text using the LLM model</p> <p>output_ids = model.generate(input_ids=input_ids)</p> <p># Decode the generated text using the tokenizer</p> <p>generated_text = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)</p> <p># Add the generated text to the sliding window</p> <p>kadane_sliding_window.add(generated_text.split())</p> <p>Benefits</p> <p>Kadane's Sliding Window offers a number of benefits for LLMs, including:</p> <p>Improved performance on tasks that require long-term memory, such as question answering and summarization.</p> <p>Increased creativity and diversity in generated text.</p> <p>Reduced need for human intervention, as the model can learn to perform tasks without being explicitly told what to do.</p> <p>Conclusion</p> <p>Kadane's Sliding Window is a powerful new tool for improving the performance of LLMs. It is simple to implement and can be used with any LLM model architecture. Kadane's Sliding Window is released under an MIT Open-Source License, so anyone can use it to improve their own LLMs.</p> <p><a href="https://turingssolutions.com/f/kadanes-sliding-window-unlimited-memory-for-any-llm-model">Release Article Contains GitHub Link</a></p> <p>Here is almost my full code from playing around with it:</p> <p>import collections</p> <p>import torch</p> <p>from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer</p> <p>class KadaneSlidingWindow:</p> <p>def __init__(self, maxlen):</p> <p>self.maxlen = maxlen</p> <p>self.window = collections.deque()</p> <p>self.long_term_memory = []</p> <p>def add(self, elements):</p> <p>for element in elements:</p> <p>self.window.append(element)</p> <p>self.long_term_memory.append(element)</p> <p>if len(self.window) &gt; self.maxlen:</p> <p>self.window.popleft()</p> <p>def get_context(self):</p> <p>return &quot; &quot;.join(self.window)</p> <p># Create a Kadane Sliding Window with a size of 1000 tokens</p> <p>kadane_sliding_window = KadaneSlidingWindow(maxlen=1000)</p> <p># Initialize the Phi-1.5 model</p> <p>model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(&quot;microsoft/phi-1_5&quot;, trust_remote_code=True, torch_dtype=&quot;auto&quot;)</p> <p>tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(&quot;microsoft/phi-1_5&quot;, trust_remote_code=True, torch_dtype=&quot;auto&quot;)</p> <p># Generate text with the Phi-1.5 model and the Kadane Sliding Window</p> <p>prompt = &quot;Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Alice who lived in a small village.

On the other hand, it poses a significant threat to publishers who depend on click-throughs for revenue and look for essential recognition.</p> <p><strong>The dilemma here is stark:</strong> allow Google to summarize your content and risk losing recognition and traffic, or opt-out and lose visibility on the web almost completely! It's like being caught between a rock and a hard place.</p> <p>So, what can publishers do to protect their interests? Here are some strategies from my understanding:</p> <p>- Optimize for Snippets - If Google is going to summarize your content, make sure it's your best content displayed and your references get included in the summaries. Use SEO strategies to optimize for featured snippets and summaries and make the most of this chance!</p> <p>- Diversify Revenue Streams - Don't put all your eggs in the Google basket. Explore other revenue-generating avenues like subscriptions, sponsored content, and merchandise.</p> <p>- Engage Directly with Your Audience - Use social media and newsletters to build a loyal community. Direct engagement can help you create an alternative route to reach your audience.</p> <p>- Collaborate and Advocate - Team up with other publishers to advocate for fair practices. There's strength in numbers.</p> <p>Having a progressive mindset to evolve with changes while striving for an equitable middle ground often the best way ahead in the dynamic digital era, but how can this be implemented by publishers in your opinion? </p> <p>Is this actually an SEO opportunity in disguise for those who can create the most helpful and summarizable content?</p> <p>Let's discuss!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/vikas_agrawal77"> /u/vikas_agrawal77 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17cyacd/googles_ai_summary_feature_has_publishers_in_a/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17cyacd/googles_ai_summary_feature_has_publishers_in_a/">[comments]</a></span>
