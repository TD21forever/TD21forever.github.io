总结: AI中没有防御模式，AI无法理解防御。如果将其武器化，那只会走向一种结果，即升级理论。如果你决定毒害一个AI模型，对此的自然对策就是毒害你的AI模型。Nightshade是一个GAN，它被设计为GAN中的生成器。我能想到的最简单的对抗方法就是直接毒害你的GAN，释放一个毒害Nightshade的模型。这将是最自然的对抗方式。 </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>There is no Defensive Mode in AI. Defense is a feature that AI does not understand. If you weaponize it, then that only goes one way. Escalation theory. If you decide to poison an AI model, the natural counter to that is to poison your AI model back. Nightshade is a GAN. It is designed to be the Generator within the GAN. The easiest method I could possibly come up with to counter this method would be to flat out poison your GAN. To release a model that poisons Nightshade. That would be the most natural counter to it.</p> <p>The reason why this code is so long, and complex, is because I very actively chose to avoid that method. All this code does is detect the adversary. It is a defensive tool as written, rather than an offensive one. It would have been 10x easier to create code that poisons any model that tries to poison another model. Where would that get AI in the end? An eye for an eye is a crappy methodology for humans to follow, why are we so quick to introduce it to AI models? </p> <p>Do I endorse AI companies scraping web data for profit? No. The opposite. Sue the pants off of any company who has engaged in such practices, that is my stance on that. I hope they lose the court battles. Don't introduce poison to the AI models though because the companies that created them scraped data. That is counter intuitive on too many levels for me to support. That is why Nightshade Antidote exists. That is why an antidote will be quickly invented and released for anyone else who tries similar tactics.</p> <p><a href="https://turingssolutions.com/f/nightshade-antidote---detect-poison-in-your-ai-model">https://turingssolutions.com/f/nightshade-antidote---detect-poison-in-your-ai-model</a> </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Fantastic-Ninja3839"> /u/Fantastic-Ninja3839 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17folbw/nightshade_antidote_detect_poison_in_your_ai_model/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17folbw/nightshade_antidote_detect_poison_in_your_ai_model/">[comments]</a></span>

<br>
总结: Nightshade是一种新的工具，通过在像素级别上破坏图像，使其对AI艺术生成器产生干扰，从而使艺术家能够保护自己的知识产权。然而，这种方法也引发了关于阻碍AI发展和道德伦理的争议。尽管Nightshade赋予了艺术家保护作品的能力，但它也引发了对有意破坏AI进展的道德问题。解决这一问题的方法可能在于建立软件工程师和艺术家之间的合作环境，并通过对话和透明度来建立信任。此外，法律框架需要与技术进步同步，以明确权利和责任的界定。 </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In the ceaseless march towards artificial intelligence (AI) sophistication, a new tool named Nightshade has emerged from the shadows, casting a pall over the unbridled exploitation of artists’ work by tech conglomerates. Developed by a group of researchers led by Ben Zhao, a computer science professor at the University of Chicago, Nightshade meticulously corrupts images at the pixel level, rendering them toxic to AI art generators like Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL). When trained on these poisoned images, AI models begin to hallucinate, misinterpreting inputs and generating bizarre outputs. This novel method gives artists a semblance of control, a way to retaliate against tech behemoths that unscrupulously harvest their creative outputs to train AI models.</p> <p>The ethical landscape this innovation traverses is as intricate as the code that underpins it. On one hand, the tool is a powerful testament to artists’ right to protect their intellectual property. However, it also symbolizes a potential roadblock in the path of AI advancement. By inducing hallucinations, Nightshade could be perceived as an act of sabotage, a deliberate attempt to stunt the growth of a technology that holds immense potential. The discord between artists and tech firms exemplifies a larger debate surrounding the ethics of AI development, particularly when it involves the use of individuals' creative work without explicit consent.</p> <p>The moral dichotomy is apparent. While Nightshade empowers artists to safeguard their creations, it also raises questions about the ethics of deliberately hampering AI progression. The underpinning rationale of Nightshade's creation is defensive, yet its offensive capabilities cannot be ignored. It’s a manifestation of the struggle between individual rights and collective technological advancement. </p> <p>Moreover, the tactic of poisoning AI models can potentially morph into a broader tool of dissent, setting a precarious precedent. What if similar tools are developed with malicious intent, leading to a future where AI can be easily poisoned and misled? The implications extend beyond the realm of art into a world where AI is intertwined with critical infrastructures.</p> <p>The solution to this impasse might lie in fostering a collaborative environment between software engineers and artists. Tech companies should not view artists as mere data points, but as stakeholders in the AI ecosystem. Initiating dialogues to understand artists’ concerns, obtaining explicit permissions, and sharing benefits could be steps towards building a harmonious relationship. Moreover, transparency in AI training data usage, and establishing clear guidelines on data sourcing can also bridge the existing trust deficit.</p> <p>Additionally, legal frameworks need to keep pace with technological advancements to provide a clear demarcation of rights and responsibilities. The current legal skirmishes between artists and tech companies underscore the urgency for robust legal frameworks that safeguard individual rights while promoting innovation.</p> <p>In conclusion, the emergence of tools like Nightshade accentuates the urgent need for a balanced approach that honors individual rights and paves the way for responsible AI development. The road ahead should be paved with collaboration, transparency, and a shared vision that elevates both art and technology.</p> <p>Thank you for reading</p> <p>Link to article: <a href="https://gizmodo.com/nightshade-poisons-ai-art-generators-dall-e-1850951218">https://gizmodo.com/nightshade-poisons-ai-art-generators-dall-e-1850951218</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Dwill354"> /u/Dwill354 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17fgcg3/university_of_chicago_researchers_develop_tool_to/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17fgcg3/university_of_chicago_researchers_develop_tool_to/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: 这是一个初学者的问题，他最近开始学习计算机科学，并对C语言的学习非常感兴趣，甚至暂时停止了他正在学习的MOOC课程（CS50x）来阅读一本关于C语言的书。他发现C语言是嵌入式系统编程中最常用的语言之一，并且最近成为他的灵感来源。他希望有一天能够从事机器人和汽车软件的工作。他对人工智能技术非常感兴趣，但有人告诉他，他感兴趣的两个领域相当不同，没有太多共同之处，也没有需要同时掌握两者的工作。他想听听有经验的人的意见，对任何反馈都表示感谢！他还有一个更具体的问题，关于他在深入学习C语言方面所花费的时间。他花了很多时间在学习上，并且非常享受。但是如果嵌入式系统和人工智能/机器学习/深度学习之间的距离如此之大，他可能会决定减少对C语言的学习。C语言在人工智能相关领域中有应用吗？ </div>

I recently begun studying computer science and I enjoyed so much studying C language that I momentarily stopped the MOOC I was following (CS50x) to read a book about C. Just love it. Studying more about the language I discovered that it's one of the most employed ones for embedded systems programming and that happen to have very recently become a great inspiration. I'd like to work on robots and cars software one day. My doubt and the point of this Reddit is that I begin studying CS because my dream is to understand and work on artificial intelligence technologies. But I got told that the two things I'm interested in are quite different and don't have much in common/there are no jobs that require both. I just wanted to hear some opinion from experienced people, any feedback is appreciated!</p> <p>Edit: a more specific question is on the time I'm dedicating to studying C in depth. I'm spending a lot of time on it and I'm really enjoying it. But if the distance between embedded systems and artificial intelligence/machine learning/deep learning is so wide I may decide to give it less effort. Is C employed in anything artificial intelligence related?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Fit-Presentation2348"> /u/Fit-Presentation2348 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17fmpz4/embedded_systems_and_artificial_intelligence/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17fmpz4/embedded_systems_and_artificial_intelligence/">[comments]</a></span>

It's a platform where you can engage in lifelike conversations with your beloved fictional or historical characters.</p> <p>With ChatFAI, you'll experience the thrill of interacting with iconic figures from literature, movies, history, and more. From Sherlock Holmes to Cleopatra, this AI-powered application brings these characters to life through realistic dialogue.</p> <p>One of the notable features is how natural it feels! And, just recently, I added voice messages. So, now, characters can send you voice messages and the voice really sounds like them :)</p> <p>But here's something cool – not only can you converse with existing public characters but also create your own private ones! This means you have endless possibilities for engaging dialogues tailored specifically to your imagination and interests.</p> <p>If all this sounds intriguing enough (and trust me, it really is), do check it.

总结: 文章讨论了在表达大量数据时使用更简洁的方式，提出了使用类似字节的命名方式来表示存储和RAM的容量，例如使用parabyte来表示一百万个参数，以及使用nano、micro、mega、kilo、tera、peta等词汇来表示不同数量级。作者认为这种方式可以避免过多使用"million"这个词，使表达更简洁。 </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Everything's in hundreds of billions, and there's only so many times you can read so many, millions, billions, thousands,, trillions before it starts to sound like a meaningless number. I'd like to try, a more succinct method of expressing these amounts, when it's comes to storage and RAM, it's rarely expressed in such a manner so I was thinking what if we used a similar system. What if we decided that something like a parabyte: ie. A million parameters, was the term to use and that, we could then use, similar nomenclature to bytes, such as having nano, micro, mega,kilo, tera, peta and such for respective amounts. Rather than having to over use the word million? I might've missed the mark, maybe this is already common practice for experts but I'm just a layperson who watched a few too many YT videos. Any other suggestions to make it more succinct. Thanks for your response.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/PseudoPatriotsNotPog"> /u/PseudoPatriotsNotPog </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17ffz13/discussing_llms_is_a_mouthful_id_like_to_suggest/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17ffz13/discussing_llms_is_a_mouthful_id_like_to_suggest/">[comments]</a></span>
