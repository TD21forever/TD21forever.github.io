<br>
<br>
总结: Nightshade是一种新的工具，通过在像素级别上破坏图像，使其对AI艺术生成器产生干扰，从而使艺术家能够保护自己的知识产权。然而，这种方法也引发了关于阻碍AI发展和道德伦理的争议。尽管Nightshade赋予了艺术家保护作品的能力，但它也引发了对有意破坏AI进展的道德问题。解决这一问题的方法可能在于建立软件工程师和艺术家之间的合作环境，并通过对话和透明度来建立信任。此外，法律框架需要与技术进步同步，以明确权利和责任的界定。 </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In the ceaseless march towards artificial intelligence (AI) sophistication, a new tool named Nightshade has emerged from the shadows, casting a pall over the unbridled exploitation of artists’ work by tech conglomerates. Developed by a group of researchers led by Ben Zhao, a computer science professor at the University of Chicago, Nightshade meticulously corrupts images at the pixel level, rendering them toxic to AI art generators like Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL). When trained on these poisoned images, AI models begin to hallucinate, misinterpreting inputs and generating bizarre outputs. This novel method gives artists a semblance of control, a way to retaliate against tech behemoths that unscrupulously harvest their creative outputs to train AI models.</p> <p>The ethical landscape this innovation traverses is as intricate as the code that underpins it. On one hand, the tool is a powerful testament to artists’ right to protect their intellectual property. However, it also symbolizes a potential roadblock in the path of AI advancement. By inducing hallucinations, Nightshade could be perceived as an act of sabotage, a deliberate attempt to stunt the growth of a technology that holds immense potential. The discord between artists and tech firms exemplifies a larger debate surrounding the ethics of AI development, particularly when it involves the use of individuals' creative work without explicit consent.</p> <p>The moral dichotomy is apparent. While Nightshade empowers artists to safeguard their creations, it also raises questions about the ethics of deliberately hampering AI progression. The underpinning rationale of Nightshade's creation is defensive, yet its offensive capabilities cannot be ignored. It’s a manifestation of the struggle between individual rights and collective technological advancement. </p> <p>Moreover, the tactic of poisoning AI models can potentially morph into a broader tool of dissent, setting a precarious precedent. What if similar tools are developed with malicious intent, leading to a future where AI can be easily poisoned and misled? The implications extend beyond the realm of art into a world where AI is intertwined with critical infrastructures.</p> <p>The solution to this impasse might lie in fostering a collaborative environment between software engineers and artists. Tech companies should not view artists as mere data points, but as stakeholders in the AI ecosystem. Initiating dialogues to understand artists’ concerns, obtaining explicit permissions, and sharing benefits could be steps towards building a harmonious relationship. Moreover, transparency in AI training data usage, and establishing clear guidelines on data sourcing can also bridge the existing trust deficit.</p> <p>Additionally, legal frameworks need to keep pace with technological advancements to provide a clear demarcation of rights and responsibilities. The current legal skirmishes between artists and tech companies underscore the urgency for robust legal frameworks that safeguard individual rights while promoting innovation.</p> <p>In conclusion, the emergence of tools like Nightshade accentuates the urgent need for a balanced approach that honors individual rights and paves the way for responsible AI development. The road ahead should be paved with collaboration, transparency, and a shared vision that elevates both art and technology.</p> <p>Thank you for reading</p> <p>Link to article: <a href="https://gizmodo.com/nightshade-poisons-ai-art-generators-dall-e-1850951218">https://gizmodo.com/nightshade-poisons-ai-art-generators-dall-e-1850951218</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Dwill354"> /u/Dwill354 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17fgcg3/university_of_chicago_researchers_develop_tool_to/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17fgcg3/university_of_chicago_researchers_develop_tool_to/">[comments]</a></span>

I'd like to try, a more succinct method of expressing these amounts, when it's comes to storage and RAM, it's rarely expressed in such a manner so I was thinking what if we used a similar system. What if we decided that something like a parabyte: ie. A million parameters, was the term to use and that, we could then use, similar nomenclature to bytes, such as having nano, micro, mega,kilo, tera, peta and such for respective amounts. Rather than having to over use the word million? I might've missed the mark, maybe this is already common practice for experts but I'm just a layperson who watched a few too many YT videos. Any other suggestions to make it more succinct.

总结: 这是一个关于人工智能如何影响创意产业的短片，通过使用A.I.来扩展Philip Glass的作品《Metamorphosis Two》，将极简主义的钢琴循环转化为极大主义的视频作品。通过A.I.生成视觉效果、剧本和旁白，它巧妙地模糊了机器和人类创造力之间的界限。在一个通用的企业宣传片的伪装下，视频逐渐进入一个荒诞的狂梦，朝着昆虫学的奇点发展。这部电影意在反映我们在追求新技术的同时，如何努力保持人性的不断升级的挣扎。 </div>

Generating its visuals, script and voiceover through A.I., it playfully blurs the line between machine and human creativity. Within the guise of a generic corporate promo, the video progresses into an absurdist fever dream towards entomologic singularity. The film intends to reflect the escalating struggle to maintain humanity, against our motivation to exploit new technology head first.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AnimalsChasingCars"> /u/AnimalsChasingCars </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17ff8ft/an_ai_video_interpretation_of_metamorphosis_two/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17ff8ft/an_ai_video_interpretation_of_metamorphosis_two/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: 不需要对AI模型进行微调就能增强它们的知识，而增强AI模型的知识可以使它们在特定任务和一般任务中表现更好。我可以告诉你这些事情，但如果我只是告诉你，你为什么要相信我呢？我可以更容易地向你展示。我根据最近在这些领域的所有研究开发了这种方法。在这个视频中，我给同一个模型提供了完全相同的提示，并展示了模型在吸收了我专门为AI模型设计的书籍之前和之后的结果。我在这里测试的书籍是一本名为“基于微积分的逻辑配方”的书籍。它包含了一些基于微积分的算法和框架，旨在增强LLM模型的演绎、归纳和/或诱导推理能力。这本书给模型提供了明确的指令和代码，模型可以自行执行和分析以利用这些框架。除了与数据无关的其他任何我正在进行的工作，我都会完全开源，采用MIT许可证。如果你是一个研究机构，并且想要免费获取这些书籍，我们可以交谈。如果有一个我认为是真正赚钱的AI领域，那就是数据。我正在销售这些书籍。我可以轻松地向任何人证明它们确实有效。购买我的一本书就像购买更多的内存、增加GPU或其他一系列专门为你的LLM或神经网络设计的东西。而且价格也无法超越！ </div>

I can tell you these things, but why believe me simply if I tell you? I can more easily show you. I developed this method specifically based on all of the recent research that has come out in these areas. </p> <p>In this video I give the same model the exact same prompts and showcase the results both before and after the model ingested my book specifically designed for AI models. The book I test here specifically is a book of 'Calculus Based Logic Recipes'. It consists of algorithms and frameworks, all calculus based, designed to increase Deductive, Inductive, and/or Abductive reasoning capabilities for an LLM model. The book gives the model explicit instructions and code it can self-execute and analyze to utilize these frameworks. </p> <p>Anything else that I am working on that is not specifically related to data, I am releasing fully open sourced, MIT licensing. If you are a research institution and want these books for free, let's talk. If there is one area of AI that I think is an actual money maker, it's data. I am selling these books. I can easily prove to anyone that they actually work. Buying one of my books is like buying more Memory, or increased GPU, or a plethora of other things, specifically for your LLM or Neural Network.

AI agents trained with Habitat 3.0 learn to find and collaborate with human partners at everyday tasks like cleaning up a house, thus improving their human partner’s efficiency.<br /> - Meta also announced Habitat Synthetic Scenes Dataset and HomeRobot– in all, three major advancements in the development of socially embodied AI agents that can cooperate with and assist humans in daily tasks.</li> <li><strong>NVIDIA’s research breakthrough, Eureka, puts a new spin on robot learning</strong><br /> - A new AI agent that can teach robots complex skills has trained a robotic hand to perform rapid pen-spinning tricks for the first time, as well as a human can. The robots have learned to expertly accomplish nearly 30 tasks thanks to Eureka, which autonomously writes reward algorithms to train bots.</li> <li><strong>OpenAI reveals DALL-E 3's secret sauce of accurate prompt generation</strong><br /> - OpenAI has published a paper on DALL-E 3, showing how the system follows prompts more accurately than other systems by using better image labels.</li> <li><strong>IBM is developing a brain-inspired chip for faster, more energy-efficient AI</strong><br /> - New research out of IBM Research’s lab, nearly two decades in the making, has the potential to drastically shift how we can efficiently scale up powerful AI hardware systems. The new type of digital AI chip for neural inference is called NorthPole.</li> <li><strong>Oracle loops in Nvidia AI for end-to-end model development</strong><br /> - Oracle is bringing Nvidia AI stack to its marketplace to simplify AI development and deployment for its customers. It gives Oracle customers access to the most sought-after, top-of-the-line GPUs for training foundation models and building generative applications.</li> <li><strong>YouTube is developing an AI tool to help creators sound like famous musicians</strong><br /> - In beta, the tool will let a select pool of artists give permission to a select group of creators to use their voices in videos on the platform. Negotiations with major labels are ongoing and slowing down the project's beta release.</li> <li><strong>There’s now an AI cancer survivor calculator</strong><br /> - Researchers have created an AI-based tool to predict a cancer patient's odds of long-term survival after a fresh diagnosis. It was found to accurately predict cancer survival length for three types of cancers.</li> <li><strong>Instagram’s latest AI feature test is a way to make stickers from photos</strong><br /> - Meta’s newest sticker feature is much like the one built into the iPhone Messages app in iOS 17– Instagram detects and cuts out an object from a photo so you can place it over another.</li> </ul> <p>More detailed breakdown of these news and innovations in the <a href="https://theaiedge.substack.com/p/meta-trains-home-cleaning-ai-agents">daily newslette</a>r.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RohitAkki"> /u/RohitAkki </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17etgka/twominute_daily_ai_update_date_10232023_news_from/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17etgka/twominute_daily_ai_update_date_10232023_news_from/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: 如果你是一个Etsy卖家或者认识一个在Etsy上销售的人，或者你在Etsy上找不到你最喜欢的店铺，可能是因为Etsy的机器人无法正确区分真实的模型图像和AI生成的模型图像。你只需要在YouTube或社交媒体上搜索“etsy模型图新闻”就可以找到相关信息。此外，Etsy对此事保持了相当的沉默，导致Etsy卖家对此感到非常困惑，因为没有人知道为什么一些没有使用AI创建模型图的店铺会成为机器人的目标。而且，并不是所有的AI生成的模型图都会被标记，所以似乎没有办法100%确定什么是AI生成的。当然，如果你购买东西，你希望得到一个准确的产品展示，但在不久的将来，你可能只能看到产品的AI展示。这表明区分真实和AI生成的东西变得越来越困难，各行各业的公司都在面临适应AI技术变革的问题。你有什么想法？ </div>

Also Etsy has been pretty quiet about this and as a result Etsy sellers are going crazy about this as no one knows why some stores who haven't used AI to create their mockups are being targeted by these bots. Also not all AI generated mockups are getting tagged so seems there's not a way to 100% tell what is AI and not anymore. Of course if you are buying something you want an accurate representation of what your getting, but in the coming future maybe all you will be able to see is an AI representation of what the product may look like....</p> <p>This just goes to show how hard is getting to distinguish between what is real and what is AI generated and how across all industries companies are having issues adapting to AI technology changes.

If i remember correctly someone said that they were different species (AI and humans) Can AI be called a new species? 2. Can a human who’s consciousness has been uploaded to a robot be called a cyborg and what defines cyborg? 3. In the movie “creator” we see Alfie a robot “child” what should Alfie be called? Since Alfie was made after the scanning of the main character and his wife’s fetus, is it considered AI? 4. Would AI and robots be considered a new species or an evolution of humans? Might come back to this once i have more questions, but for now its late and I’m going to bed, good night.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Demonzack"> /u/Demonzack </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17ex2rv/question_about_ai_and_stuffalso_involving_the/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17ex2rv/question_about_ai_and_stuffalso_involving_the/">[comments]</a></span>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am excited to announce the release of KyberCloak, a new encryption algorithm designed to resist quantum attacks. KyberCloak is based on post-quantum lattice-based cryptography, which is considered to be one of the most promising approaches to cryptography in the age of quantum computing.</p> <p>KyberCloak is released under an MIT license, so anyone can use it for any purpose, including commercial use. I hope that KyberCloak will be widely adopted and help to protect our data from quantum attacks in the future.</p> <p>I also hope that KyberCloak will inspire more people to look into the challenge of developing quantum-resistant encryption algorithms. It is a very difficult task, but it is essential to ensure the security of our data in the future.</p> <p>If you are interested in learning more about KyberCloak including accessing the Github link to the code, please visit the project website at <a href="https://turingssolutions.com/f/introducing-kybercloak---a-new-way-to-keep-your-messages-private">https://turingssolutions.com/f/introducing-kybercloak---a-new-way-to-keep-your-messages-private</a>.</p> <p>**Why is quantum-resistant encryption important?**</p> <p>Quantum computers are expected to be able to break many of the encryption algorithms that are used today. This would have a devastating impact on our security, as it would allow attackers to access our sensitive data, such as financial information, personal communications, and government secrets.</p> <p>Quantum-resistant encryption algorithms are designed to be secure even against quantum attacks. This makes them essential for protecting our data in the future.</p> <p>**What is KyberCloak?**</p> <p>KyberCloak is a new encryption algorithm that is based on post-quantum lattice-based cryptography. Lattice-based cryptography is considered to be one of the most promising approaches to cryptography in the age of quantum computing.</p> <p>KyberCloak is very efficient and can be used to encrypt data of any size. It is also very flexible and can be used in a variety of applications, such as secure messaging, data storage, and network security.</p> <p>**How can I use KyberCloak?**</p> <p>To use KyberCloak, you will need to generate a public key and a private key. The public key can be shared with anyone, but the private key must be kept secret.</p> <p>To encrypt a message, you will need to use the public key of the recipient. To decrypt a message, you will need to use your private key.</p> <p>**Challenge to the community:**</p> <p>I hope that more people look into this challenge and try to develop new encryption algorithms that cannot be cracked by quantum computers. It is a very difficult challenge, but it is important one. The future of our security depends on it. This algorithm borrows ~85% from existing work and research in this area. My initial challenge I set for myself was to try and come up with something wholly new in this area. I could not do it. Lattice based frameworks are the only thing that are currently known to work. KyberCloak is a significant improvement on existing Lattice frameworks, Eventually, we will need something more. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Fantastic-Ninja3839"> /u/Fantastic-Ninja3839 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17elw4g/kybercloak_a_new_encryption_algorithm_to_resist/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17elw4g/kybercloak_a_new_encryption_algorithm_to_resist/">[comments]</a></span>
