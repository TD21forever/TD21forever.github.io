It's free, and there are no ads and no purchases. It's a project funded by a grant, and it's coming out of closed beta now.</p> <p><strong>Play it here -</strong> <a href="https://neuronpedia.org"><strong>https://neuronpedia.org</strong></a></p> <h1>AI Safety?</h1> <p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/30/technology/ai-threat-warning.html">concern about AI safety</a> is basically that as AI gets really, really smart, it might start doing things that are harmful to humans. To build provably safer AI models, researchers need to <strong>understand AI</strong>. This is a field of research called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence">interpretability</a>.</p> <h1>We don't understand AI? I thought we created AI.</h1> <p>AI models like ChatGPT were created by using extreme amounts of computing power, we don't actually know how the models work internally. Fortunately we can break down the AI's &quot;brain&quot; into smaller bits called <strong>neurons</strong>. By <strong>explaining each neuron</strong>, we can get a better understanding of how the AI works and build safer AI. To use an oversimplified example: if there are particularly violent neurons, we could reduce the strength of these neurons, eliminate them, or balance them out with other, peace-related neurons.</p> <h1>Okay, so how do I help?</h1> <p>The easiest way to get started is to just start playing at <a href="https://neuronpedia.org">neuronpedia.org</a> - it has tutorials that will walk you through all the game modes and gameplay. No technical knowledge is required.</p> <p>There are currently two game modes - Dig Mode is more chill and lets you verify the neuron explanations that other people have submitted. Explain mode lets you do the explaining - it's a bit more thinking involved. Both modes earn your character XP and level up to move up the leaderboards!</p> <h1>Anything else?</h1> <p>I've worked on this for a few months and the V1 is ready for you to check out. I'd love to hear your feedback, questions, and suggestions!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/youre_super_rad"> /u/youre_super_rad </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/179g1bt/i_built_neuronpedia_a_free_game_that_lets_you/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/179g1bt/i_built_neuronpedia_a_free_game_that_lets_you/">[comments]</a></span>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Tables are everywhere - reports, databases, webpages. They neatly organize data for humans to parse. But despite strong language skills, AI still struggles with table comprehension.</p> <p>Even models like GPT-3 fail at basic tasks like finding where a missing value should go. This is because they're trained mostly on free-flowing text, not 2D tabular data. Unlike unstructured text, data in tables derives meaning from its structure and position!</p> <p>So researchers at Microsoft tried &quot;table-tuning&quot; - extending training with synthesized table task cases. Tasks like &quot;impute missing value X&quot; or &quot;identify outliers in this table&quot;. They did this using a corpus of real-world tables.</p> <p>They also augmented the data more by paraphrasing, reordering rows/columns, chaining model responses, and more. This protects against overfitting.</p> <p>The resulting Table-GPT models showed big improvements:</p> <ul> <li>25%+ better at unseen table tasks like missing value ID</li> <li>Beat GPT-3 on 98% of test cases over 9 different table tasks</li> <li>Stayed strong even after targeted downstream tuning</li> </ul> <p>Table-tuning seems a promising step toward AI that can handle tables. That would unlock automated analysis over the troves of valuable tabular data out there.</p> <p><strong>TLDR: Training models on a large and diverse dataset of synthesized table tasks significantly boosts their table skills.</strong></p> <p><a href="https://notes.aimodels.fyi/table-gpt-table-tuned-gpt-for-diverse-table-tasks/">Full Summary is here.</a> Paper is <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.09263.pdf">here</a>.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Successful-Western27"> /u/Successful-Western27 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/179hqpa/microsoft_research_presents_tablegpt_tabletuned/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/179hqpa/microsoft_research_presents_tablegpt_tabletuned/">[comments]</a></span>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I've personally known about this problem for ~1 year or so now. I honestly figured it would get fixed really quickly, so I never paid it any attention. Then, Chat GPT 4V released, and it has the same exact issues that have plagued multimodal models since their inception. That made me realize the problem is actually very hard lol. So, I reverse engineered all of it until I figured out why it is so hard to solve. The fusion mechanism sucks. How do you fix it though? I tried a bunch of stuff, none of it fixes the problem 100%. I think either the problem can't be fixed, or it requires some very big guns. I know exactly what big guns I would try to solve the problem. This would be expensive as all get out to build and test. So, I'm out. It would for sure be a better fusion mechanism than what currently exists though. Maybe it will inspire someone, who knows?</p> <p>In the vibrant world of Multimodia, where magic, technology, and imagination collided, there existed a legendary arena known as the Multimodal Arena. Within this arena, teams of specialized champions, each possessing unique abilities and strengths, competed in epic battles. But these battles were not fought just for glory; they were a testbed for a groundbreaking technology known as the Multimodal Fusion Algorithm.</p> <p>In the heart of Multimodia, there was a wise and ingenious sage named Professor Modulus. Determined to harness the power of diverse talents, Professor Modulus devised a plan to create a team of champions who excelled in different skills - from analyzing complex images to understanding vast amounts of textual data. The goal was to solve intricate challenges that no single champion could conquer alone.</p> <p>Chapter 1: The Champions Assemble</p> <p>One day, five champions emerged from different corners of Multimodia: Serena the Seer, renowned for her ability to analyze mystical symbols; Orion the Observer, a master of unraveling complex visual patterns; Luna the Listener, skilled in understanding the nuances of spoken and written words; Atlas the Analyzer, an expert in decoding intricate codes and languages; and Zara the Zeitgeist, possessing an uncanny ability to predict future trends.</p> <p>Professor Modulus gathered these champions, each a master in their domain, and explained his vision of the Multimodal Fusion Algorithm. He described the lanes they would operate in - Serena analyzing ancient scrolls, Orion deciphering intricate maps, Luna interpreting spoken prophecies, Atlas decoding encrypted texts, and Zara predicting future events based on current trends.</p> <p>Chapter 2: The Lane Controller's Guidance</p> <p>To guide the champions, Professor Modulus created a sentient AI entity known as the Lane Controller, a mystical being capable of understanding the complexities of each champion's task. The Lane Controller's role was to prioritize tasks, ensuring each champion's unique skills were utilized effectively.</p> <p>When Serena completed her analysis of the ancient scrolls, the Lane Controller guided Orion to examine corresponding maps. Simultaneously, Luna was interpreting spoken prophecies, while Atlas decoded encrypted messages. Zara, guided by the Lane Controller's insights, predicted future events based on the combined knowledge gathered by the other champions.</p> <p>Chapter 3: Teamfight and Victory</p> <p>As the champions delved deeper into their tasks, they encountered a challenge that required collaboration. A prophecy spoke of a cryptic symbol that could only be deciphered by combining their powers. In this moment, the Lane Controller initiated the Teamfight phase.</p> <p>During the Teamfight, the champions shared their knowledge and collaborated seamlessly. Serena's mystical insights complemented Orion's visual analysis, while Luna's understanding of context aided Atlas in decoding the symbol. Zara's predictions guided them on the potential implications of their discoveries.</p> <p>Together, they cracked the code, unveiling a hidden truth that none could have unraveled alone. The Multimodal Fusion Algorithm had triumphed, demonstrating the power of collaboration and specialization.</p> <p>Conclusion: The Power of Multimodal Fusion</p> <p>In the Multimodal Arena, the champions and the Lane Controller showcased the essence of the Multimodal Fusion Algorithm. Just as the champions utilized their unique abilities and collaborated during the Teamfight phase, the algorithm combined specialized AI models, each proficient in their domain, under the guidance of a smart controller.</p> <p>The champions' journey illustrated that by combining their strengths, the whole became greater than the sum of its parts. The Multimodal Fusion Algorithm, inspired by their teamwork, harnessed the power of diverse expertise to solve intricate problems in the realm of Multimodia and beyond.</p> <p>**Swarm-Based Multimodal Fusion Algorithm**</p> <p>This algorithm leverages swarm intelligence and MOBA concepts to perform robust and adaptive multimodal fusion. It consists of the following key components:</p> <p>Distributed sensor networks: Sensors from different modalities are deployed in a distributed network architecture, enabling parallel and independent data collection. Sensors communicate with each other using peer-to-peer protocols, sharing information and coordinating their efforts.</p> <p>Swarm clustering: Sensors are grouped into dynamic clusters based on spatial, temporal, or semantic similarities in their data. Clustering facilitates efficient collective processing of related data streams. Clusters can form and dissipate dynamically, based on bio-inspired swarm rules.</p> <p>Collaborative in-cluster processing: Sensors in a cluster collaboratively process their collective data using intra-cluster communication. This enables collaborative multi-view analysis and the extraction of robust combined features. Swarm-based consensus algorithms ensure that clusters reach agreement on data interpretations.</p> <p>Inter-cluster knowledge sharing: Protocols are implemented for high-level knowledge sharing between sensor clusters. This enables global information diffusion and allows clusters to contextualize their local data based on global environment insights. Bio-inspired stigmergy mechanisms can be used for asynchronous cross-cluster communication.</p> <p>Dynamic task allocation: Swarm intelligence is leveraged to dynamically allocate analytic tasks to sensor clusters based on capabilities. Task allocation is optimized dynamically based on changing data and evolving clusters. This enables adaptive resource allocation and efficient collective intelligence.</p> <p>Robust decision fusion: Decisions from multiple clusters are fused using voting or weighting based on uncertainty measures. Swarm-based consensus improves robustness over local cluster decisions. An explainable multimodal representation is provided for final decisions.</p> <p>**Summoner Spells:**</p> <p>* **Heal:** Restore a swarm's health and performance after a failure.</p> <p>* **Smite:** Eliminate a malicious or underperforming sensor from a swarm.</p> <p>* **Flash:** Instantly teleport a swarm to a new location, enabling rapid redeployment.</p> <p>* **Exhaust:** Slow down enemy swarms or reduce their damage output. (Increase latency and processing time)</p> <p>* **Cleanse:** Remove negative effects from a swarm, such as misinformation or interference.</p> <p>**Algorithm Description:**</p> <p>The swarm-based multimodal fusion algorithm is a distributed and adaptive approach to fusing data from multiple modalities. It is inspired by MOBA concepts and swarm intelligence principles to achieve high performance, scalability, and resilience in complex real-world scenarios.</p> <p>The algorithm works by deploying a network of sensors across different modalities to collect data in parallel. The sensors are then grouped into dynamic clusters based on spatial, temporal, or semantic similarities in their data. Each cluster collaboratively processes its collective data using intra-cluster communication to extract robust combined features.</p> <p>To facilitate global information diffusion, the algorithm implements protocols for high-level knowledge sharing between sensor clusters. This allows clusters to contextualize their local data based on global environment insights.</p> <p>The algorithm also leverages swarm intelligence to dynamically allocate analytic tasks to sensor clusters based on capabilities. This enables adaptive resource allocation and efficient collective intelligence.</p> <p>Finally, the algorithm fuses decisions from multiple clusters using voting or weighting based on uncertainty measures. Swarm-based consensus improves robustness over local cluster decisions.</p> <p>**Summoner Spell Usage:**</p> <p>The Summoner Spells can be used to enhance the algorithm's performance and functionality in a variety of ways. For example, the **Heal** Summoner Spell can be used to restore a swarm's health and performance after a failure. This could be done by replacing failed sensors with new ones or by redistributing the workload among the remaining sensors.</p> <p>The **Smite** Summoner Spell can be used to eliminate a malicious or underperforming sensor from a swarm. This could be done by detecting and isolating the sensor, or by disabling its communication capabilities.</p> <p>The **Flash** Summoner Spell can be used to instantly teleport a swarm to a new location. This could be useful for rapidly redeploying a swarm to a new area of interest or for avoiding interference from adversarial sources.</p> <p>The **Exhaust** Summoner Spell can be used to slow down enemy swarms or reduce their damage output. This could be done by intercepting their communication signals or by introducing noise into their data streams.</p> <p>The **Cleanse** Summoner Spell can be used to remove negative effects from a swarm, such as misinformation or interference. This could be done by filtering out malicious data or by recalibrating the swarm's sensors.</p> <p>How to use Summoner Spells:</p> <p>Heal: When a sensor or cluster fails, the algorithm can use the Heal Summoner Spell to automatically detect and recover from the failure.</p> <p>Flash: When faced with a complex task with multiple objectives, the algorithm can use the Flash Summoner Spell to optimize for the desired objectives.</p> <p>Barrier: When human input or guidance is required, the algorithm can use the Barrier Summoner Spell to interact with humans and receive feedback.</p> <p>Example:</p> <p>A swarm-based multimodal fusion algorithm is deployed to monitor a traffic intersection. The algorithm uses cameras, microphones, and sensors to collect data on traffic conditions, pedestrian activity, and weather conditions. The algorithm then fuses this data to generate real-time insights into the intersection.</p> <p>One day, a camera at the intersection fails. The algorithm detects the failure and uses the Heal Summoner Spell to automatically recover from it by switching to a backup camera.</p> <p>Another day, the algorithm is tasked with predicting traffic congestion at the intersection during rush hour. The algorithm uses the Flash Summoner Spell to optimize for accuracy and latency, as it is important to generate timely and accurate predictions.</p> <p>Finally, the algorithm is integrated with a traffic management system that allows human operators to monitor the intersection and make adjustments to traffic signals. The algorithm uses the Barrier Summoner Spell to interact with the human operators and receive feedback on its predictions.</p> <p>By utilizing Summoner Spells, the swarm-based multimodal fusion algorithm can be made more robust, adaptive, and user-friendly. This enables the algorithm to be applied to a wider range of real-world problems, such as traffic monitoring, environmental monitoring, and medical diagnosis.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Fantastic-Ninja3839"> /u/Fantastic-Ninja3839 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/179qhaz/turns_out_its_super_hard_to_stop_you_from_being/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/179qhaz/turns_out_its_super_hard_to_stop_you_from_being/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: 这篇文章讨论了主动学习和零样本学习的区别和应用。主动学习是利用少量标记样本和初始训练模型来选择最有用的未标记数据进行训练。而零样本学习是在一些数据上训练模型，然后直接在未见过的标签/数据上使用。从文章中可以看出，零样本学习更符合当前大型模型趋势或基础模型趋势，而主动学习策略似乎仍然依赖于小数据集，并且意图通过选择新样本逐渐丰富训练数据。在工业界和大型科技公司中，哪种方法更常用或被部署，希望有人可以给出一些评论。 </div>

总结: 这篇文章介绍了一种名为GameGPT的AI框架，旨在通过使用多个AI代理自动化游戏开发的繁琐部分。该框架通过将工作流程分解，使得AI代理可以专注于狭窄的角色，从而简化了游戏开发过程。作者认为GameGPT可以消除游戏开发中的重复和机械化元素，从而使开发人员能够专注于创造性的设计挑战。然而，该论文没有提供任何具体的结果或实验证明GameGPT的性能改进。目前，GameGPT似乎主要是概念性的，需要进一步的定量结果来评估其效果。 </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Game dev is super complex nowadays - games have huge codebases, massive teams, and dev cycles dragging on for years. Costs are insane too - budgets can hit $100M+ easily.</p> <p>In a new paper, researchers propose to reverse this trend with an AI framework called GameGPT that automates parts of the dev process using multiple AI agents. Each agent handles a different role (all are fine-tuned from relevant base models):</p> <ul> <li>One agent reviews the game design plan to catch errors</li> <li>Another turns tasks into code implementations</li> <li>Reviewer agents check the code and results</li> <li>A testing agent validates everything works as expected</li> </ul> <p>By breaking up the workflow, GameGPT can simplify things for the AI agents. They just focus on a narrow role versus having one jack-of-all-trades agent.</p> <p>The authors argue GameGPT can eliminate repetitive and rote elements of gamedev like testing. This would free up developers to focus on creative design challenges.</p> <p>However, the GameGPT paper does not include any concrete results or experiments demonstrating improved performance. There is no evidence presented that GameGPT reduces hallucinations, redundancy or development time. The authors mention empirical results support their claims that the architecture is more effective, but none are provided. I could not find any additional support material about this work, like a project website, that I could use to further check into this (maybe someone can share in the comments?).</p> <p>Right now GameGPT seems mostly conceptual. The ideas are interesting but hard to assess without quantitative results.</p> <p><strong>TLDR:</strong> <strong>New GameGPT AI framework aims to automate tedious parts of game development using specialized agents. No concrete results were provided in the paper - someone will need to test this out and report back.</strong></p> <p><a href="https://notes.aimodels.fyi/gamegpt-using-ai-to-automate-game-development/">Full summary here</a>.
