                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Researchers from Anthropic, including former OpenAI members, have proposed a novel approach to understanding artificial neural networks. Instead of focusing on individual neurons, they identify combinations of neurons forming patterns or features. These features are more interpretable and consistent, allowing for better control over the network's behavior. Using dictionary learning, they decompose a layer with 512 neurons into over 4,000 features, representing diverse concepts. Human evaluators found these features easier to understand than neurons, and they allow for precise control of network behavior. This approach offers a potential breakthrough in AI safety and paves the way for a deeper understanding of neural networks, bridging the gap between computer science and neuroscience.

Combining an AI chatbot with the Carbon Interface API gives a quick and easy overview of CO2 emissions from a number of activities.<br /> There are still a number of limitations. Like any LLM, it can make factual errors and mistakes but it would be great to see what you guys think.</p> <p><a href="https://usesuperflows.com/carbon-gpt">https://usesuperflows.com/carbon-gpt</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BiologyNerd100"> /u/BiologyNerd100 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/173oaos/carbongpt_a_chatbot_for_carbon_emissions_research/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/173oaos/carbongpt_a_chatbot_for_carbon_emissions_research/">[comments]</a></span>

<br>
<br>
总结: 主流新闻媒体更愿意报道哈马斯-以色列战争的升级，而不是双方和平谈判的公平解决。这是因为冲突和暴力比复杂的政治谈判更具视觉吸引力和易于理解。战争更加紧迫，正在发生，有很多新闻可以报道。哈马斯-以色列冲突是世界上最具争议性的之一，双方都有强烈的观点，新闻媒体通常感觉有必要报道所有观点。另外，需要注意的是新闻媒体并不是一个统一的实体，不同的新闻机构有不同的观点和偏见。一些新闻机构可能更有可能以强调战争升级的方式报道战争，而其他新闻机构可能更有可能以强调和平解决可能性的方式报道战争。 </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>There are a few reasons why the mainstream news media talks about the Hamas-Israel war escalating rather than about the two sides peacefully negotiating a fair resolution.</p> <ul> <li><strong>The war is more newsworthy.</strong> News outlets are often more interested in reporting on conflict and violence than on peaceful negotiations. This is because conflict and violence are more visually appealing and easier to understand than complex political negotiations.</li> <li><strong>The war is more immediate.</strong> The war is happening right now, and there is a lot of news to report on it. </li> <li><strong>The war is more controversial.</strong> The Hamas-Israel conflict is one of the most controversial in the world. There are strong opinions on both sides, and the news media often feels the need to report on all of them. Negotiations, on the other hand, are often less controversial, and the news media may not feel the need to give them as much coverage.</li> </ul> <p>It is also important to note that the news media is not a monolithic entity. Different news outlets have different perspectives and biases. Some news outlets may be more likely to report on the war in a way that emphasizes its escalation, while others may be more likely to report on it in a way that emphasizes the possibility of a peaceful resolution.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Georgeo57"> /u/Georgeo57 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17363fo/ai_political_instincts_test_why_does_the/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17363fo/ai_political_instincts_test_why_does_the/">[comments]</a></span>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all, I run an AI tools directory and thought I'd take the time to share some of my top picks for GPT-powered tools that create visual presentations/slides. Keep in mind none of these will completely replace manual work if you want something very high quality, but they do get the job done and takes out 90% of the work required. Without further ado, here's a few that I've tried and liked, as well as my thoughts on them:</p> <p>Highnote.io - Great for Visually Appealing Slides</p> <p>A considerable time saver for anyone frequently creating presentations. highnote provides a broad collection of smart slide templates, enabling you to build appealing and meaningful presentations swiftly. I was particularly impressed with its ability to automatically organize and design content in minutes, irrespective of your graphic design experience. It also offers slide templates for various needs, from timelines, sales funnels, SWOT analysis, to more specific ones like data &amp; charts, visual impact slides, and so forth. The free trial is more than adequate for getting a feel of the service, and their paid plans start at $30/mo. It's available as a web app and integrates with cloud platforms (i.e. Dropbox and Google Drive).</p> <p>Plus AI for Google Slides- Great for Work; Presentations with Live Data in Snapshots</p> <p>A fantastic tool for automating and enhancing my Google Slides presentations. Plus AI lets you start with a brief description of the presentation you need an an AI-generated outline is created, which you can then adjust according to your requirements. In addition, it lets you make 'Snapshots' from any web content which can be embedded and updated in my slides or documents with just one click. This is particularly useful for my team meetings and project reports as it significantly reduces preparation time. It's available for free on the Google Marketplace as an add-on for GSlides.</p> <p>Tome - Great for Business Storytelling</p> <p>Generates a narrative based on a simple prompt, turning it into a presentation, outline, or story with both text and images. I found it very efficient for creating dynamic, responsive presentations, and appreciated how the AI could automatically cite sources or translate content into other languages. It's an intuitive tool for anyone who needs to deliver compelling stories or presentations, from founders and executives to educators. A standout feature is the ability to embed live interactive content, such as product mockups and data, directly onto your page, bringing the storytelling experience to life. It's available for free as a web app, with integrations for apps such as Figma, YouTube, Twitter, and GSheets.</p> <p>STORYD - Business Storytelling, with Script Generator</p> <p>This tool has truly revolutionized my approach to data presentations. By simply providing a brief summary of my topic, StoryD employs AI to script, design, and generate a presentation in less than a minute. Not only does this tool save me an immense amount of time, but its built-in 'storytelling structure' enhances the communicability and impact of my data. I also appreciate its customization options, such as themes, fonts, colors, and a plethora of layout options. The free limited beta version offers enough for the casual user, but the pro version at $18/mo adds useful features like team collaboration and real-time editing. Available as a web app.</p> <p>Albus - Knowledge Presentations/Cards/Map</p> <p>Changes the way you typically interact with knowledge and facts; it harnesses the power of GPT to create an engaging and exploratory learning experience around any topic. Basically you start with with a single question and prompt, and you get a fact card, which you can then expand into other cards and images. I appreciate the way it opens up new perspectives and angles, allowing me to dive into a subject, ask questions, and organically grow my understanding. The ability to add notes and images to organize my board further enriches the experience. And when it's time to share, I love how Albus AI facilitates controlled content presentation. With Albus AI, it's not just about learning, but also about the journey of discovery. It's available as a web app, and currently in Beta.</p> <p>Decktopus - Great Overall for Work/Business, &quot;Microsites&quot;</p> <p>Decktopus AI takes the pain out of crafting presentations. Simply key in a topic and it generates a fully fleshed out deck in an instant, which is a boon for my quick-turnaround needs. Its one-click design feature and auto-adjusted layouts simplify the customization process, saving me the headache of manual tweaking. I also appreciate the built-in tools such as image &amp; icon suggestions, tailored slide notes, and extra content generation which further streamline the creation process. Its additional features, like voice recording and real-time audience feedback collection, elevate my presentations to a new level. For quick, professional-looking presentations, Decktopus AI is my go-to. It can also handle generating micro-sites (basically something that's between a LinkTree and an landing page in terms of complexity). It's available as a web app for free.</p> <p>Gamma - Good Alternative to Decktopus</p> <p>A fresh take on presentations, Gamma marries the depth of documents with the visual appeal of slides, powered by AI for efficiency. It lets me draft ideas quickly and the AI transforms them into professional-looking presentations in a snap. The interface is incredibly intuitive, allowing for nested cards for detailing and the ability to embed various forms of content, including GIFs, videos, charts, and websites. My favorite feature is the one-click restyle, removing the tedious task of manual formatting. Sharing the content is simple and works on all devices. Plus, it offers built-in analytics, which adds a nice touch to understand audience engagement.</p> <p>SlidesAI - Text to Slides for Google Slides</p> <p>A real game-changer for those frequently tasked with creating presentations. SlidesAI integrates seamlessly into Google Slides, transforming your raw text into professionally-styled slides in just seconds. The AI parses your input, breaking it down into digestible, summarized points, even providing automatic subtitles for each page - all in over 100 different languages. It not only eliminates the tedious task of manual slide creation but also offers a real time-saver when summarizing longer texts. While the free tier allows you to create up to 3 presentations a month, I personally found value in the Pro plan for the higher character limit and additional presentations per month. It's available on Google Marketplace as a add-on for Slides.</p> <p>MagicSlides - Idea to Slides for Google Slides</p> <p>Transforms ideas into professional-looking Google Slides in seconds, eliminating the tedious work of designing and creating slides from scratch. I just input the topic and slide count, and it auto-generates a presentation for me, complete with relevant images and eye-catching layouts. Personalization options like theme selection, font choice, and color palette further enhance the final result. The app also supports over 100 languages, which is immensely helpful when I'm dealing with international projects. Like SlidesAI you get 3 free presentations per month and it's available as an add-on for Google Slides.</p> <p>Feel free to try these tools for yourself to get a feel for GPT's potential as a visulization tool, and I hope this list will help at least some of you save some time for your next presentation at work!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/UpvoteBeast"> /u/UpvoteBeast </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/172rhng/here_are_some_ai_tools_you_can_use_for/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/172rhng/here_are_some_ai_tools_you_can_use_for/">[comments]</a></span>

This is a pain for developing countries without resources to test options. But AI could help auto-generate diverse and valid design options.</p> <p>In a new paper, researchers propose using Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to sample varied roundabout layouts. Their approach works by constructing layouts step-by-step, maximizing rewards for realism, diversity, and safety.</p> <p>They also use a clever approximation during training. Rather than simulating traffic, they quickly check road intersections to focus the search (This sped up training by 200x).</p> <p>The authors tested their generated roundabout designs on simulated road scenarios of different complexity. Their model generated more diverse designs than rule-based or reinforcement learning approaches while maintaining realism and traffic flow.</p> <p>Plus, as road connections increased, the model kept discovering novel options without compromising quality.</p> <p>I thought this paper was an awesome proof-of-concept for auto-generating better roundabouts with AI, and I especially liked the authors' angle of leveraging this technology to specifically help developing countries. This could help them design higher-quality transportation networks faster and cheaper. (Plus I also like Cities: Skylines but struggle at building roundabouts).</p> <p><strong>TLDR: Roundabouts are costly to design.

This is my passion project, and I am looking forward to it.</p> <p>Todays version can: sing, play random animations, has pretty complex character, can tell stories on her own (kind of self prompting, want to rework it in future) and voice created by me. Also there is priority que, that helps ai decide what to do and what not at times. If you have more questions, ask me them in chat!</p> <p>Vtuber model was created by really experienced rigger, and is original, as voice and character is. Remember, when creating AI streamer, goal is to create persona, not to impersonate or copy it.</p> <p>I am actively working on bringing new features (currently working on Aiya being able to play Osu) so all feedback will be appreciated!</p> <p>Todays stream is longer, and I think 4 or 5 song covers will be showcased.
