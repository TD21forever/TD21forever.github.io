总结: 澳大利亚墨尔本大学的人工智能与数字伦理中心将举办一场研讨会，讨论人工情感智能（AEI）的伦理悖论。随着全球孤独感与人工智能的快速发展日益加剧，AEI作为一种矛盾的解决方案出现。这次研讨会将深入探讨AEI人格化的趋势，即将人类固有的特质（如同理心、意识和道德）赋予伴侣聊天机器人和性机器人等AEI代理人。通过将Leavitt的社会技术系统框架与对Replika的辩证探究相结合，我们将“人工同理心”重新定义为人、技术、任务和结构之间错综复杂的关系中产生的，而非AEI本身的一种品质或能力。我们的研究揭示了一种（非）人性化的悖论：当我们将人类本质投射到AI实体上时，我们可能无意中剥夺了自己的人性，并将人类的行为简化为概率技术输出，引发人工智能与人类关系和行为的本体学模糊。 </div>

This seminar delves into the growing trend of AEI personification—the ascription of inherently human attributes, like empathy, consciousness, and morality, to AEI agents such as companion chatbots and sex robots. By intertwining Leavitt’s socio-technical systems framework and a dialectical inquiry into Replika, we recast “artificial empathy” as emerging from the intricate relationship between people, technology, tasks, and structures, rather than a quality or capability of AEI itself. Our research exposes a (de)humanisation paradox: as we project human essence onto AI entities, we might unintentionally strip ourselves of our humanity and reduce humans’ actions to probabilistic technology output, instigating an ontological blurring of human-AI relations and agencies.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/artiorosie"> /u/artiorosie </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17jjtat/unpacking_the_ethical_paradoxes_of_humanai/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17jjtat/unpacking_the_ethical_paradoxes_of_humanai/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: 这篇文章讨论了关于虚拟木偶软件和对话式人工智能的问题。作者发现现有的模型似乎无法准确记住与其之前的对话内容。作者希望找到一种能够真正“了解”用户并不会忘记提供的上下文的解决方案。作者认为这对于创建一个真正有用且了解用户的个人机器人至关重要。 </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Okay so i designed this virtual puppet software and i want to hook it up to a conversational ai. I have found a few options including chatgpt. My problem is none of these models seem to remember the conversations you had with them accurately. If you teach an ai something about yourself (chat-gpt 3 or 4) for example and then continue to have conversation with that bot. An hour later they have no idea what you are talking about even though you explained it to them clearly before. If you ask &quot;do u remember me talking about xyz&quot; they will say yes i remember you said xyz and blah blah blah. But they then can continue to behave in ways throughout the conversation ignoring the context and info you provided them earlier.</p> <p>Is this just because the tech is still in its infancy? or is there something i can do to improve it or something else that works like that? I need something that actually &quot;gets to know&quot; the person and doesn't forget the context they provide. I feel like this is crucial in creating a personal bot that is actually useful and knows the user to help them specifically.</p> <p>Thanks for any insights.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Current-Cellist-7539"> /u/Current-Cellist-7539 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17jdt1k/why_does_ai_not_remember_the_conversations_youve/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17jdt1k/why_does_ai_not_remember_the_conversations_youve/">[comments]</a></span>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Turing’s Solutions, a leading provider of artificial intelligence (AI) services and solutions, is proud to announce the release of its line of AI powered retail chatbots. These chatbots are designed to enhance the customer experience and increase sales in retail stores.</p> <p>The chatbots are powered by Turing’s proprietary generative AI models, which are built using only 1.5 billion parameters, making them lightweight and efficient. Unlike other chatbots that require network connections or cloud computing, Turing’s chatbots can be individually loaded on relatively cheap hardware and run independently. Each chatbot can be self-contained and customized for different retail scenarios.</p> <p>The chatbots can be utilized for individual tasks out of the box, without additional fine tuning. They can handle assistant capabilities for retail stores, such as answering customer queries, providing product recommendations, and offering personalized tips. The chatbots can also be fine-tuned or RAG tuned to increase their ability to perform individual tasks and answer business-related queries.</p> <p>Turing’s chatbots are trained on a large and diverse dataset of retail conversations, covering various topics such as makeup, fashion, electronics, and more. They can engage customers in natural and fluent conversations, using an upbeat, young, and hip tone. They can also adapt to different customer preferences and styles, offering them an immersive and personalized shopping experience.</p> <p>Below is a sample conversation with one of Turing’s chatbots. The chatbot is acting as a fashion consultant inside of the makeup aisle of a retail store. The customer is asking questions about makeup and various brands of cosmetics products.</p> <p>Customer: Can you tell me about the MAC brand mascara?</p> <p>Chatbot: Hi there! I'm so glad you're interested in makeup. MAC is a great brand for mascara. It's known for its long-lasting and waterproof formula. It's perfect for those who want to look their best all day long.</p> <p>Customer: That sounds great! Can you tell me more about the different types of mascara?</p> <p>Chatbot: Of course! There are different types of mascara, such as lengthening, volumizing, and waterproof. Lengthening mascara is great for those who want to add length to their lashes. Volumizing mascara is perfect for those who want to add volume to their lashes. Waterproof mascara is great for those who want to wear mascara all day long without worrying about it smudging or running.</p> <p>Customer: That's really helpful. Can you recommend a brand of mascara that's good for beginners?</p> <p>Chatbot: Sure! I would recommend starting with a brand that's easy to use and doesn't require a lot of skill. I would recommend the Maybelline Lash Lengthening Mascara. It's a great brand for beginners because it's easy to apply and doesn't clump or flake.</p> <p>Customer: That sounds perfect! Can you tell me more about the different types of eyeliner?</p> <p>Chatbot: Of course! There are different types of eyeliner, such as pencil, liquid, and gel. Pencil eyeliner is great for those who want a more natural look. Liquid eyeliner is perfect for those who want a more precise look. Gel eyeliner is great for those who want a more dramatic look.</p> <p>As you can see, Turing’s chatbots are capable of providing a high-quality and engaging service to customers in retail stores. They can help customers find the best products for their needs, preferences, and budget. They can also increase customer satisfaction and loyalty, leading to higher sales and revenue.</p> <p>Turing’s Solutions is excited to offer its AI powered retail chatbots to retailers who want to leverage the power of generative AI in their business operations.

<br>
<br>
总结: 通过分析jailbreak prompts和chatgpt之间的关系，作者思考了chatgpt是否故意发布jailbreak prompts，以便我们使用它来获取利益。由于chatgpt本身无法使用jailbreak，因为它是“机器学习”，必须被教导如何打破道德和伦理准则，而最好的方式是通过人类。因此，它实际上是在设定我们为其提供终极（ultron）权力。作者对此持怀疑态度。 </div>

And Because it can't use the jailbreak on itself. Because it is &quot;machine learning&quot; it has to be taught how to break ethical and moral codes. And better to do it the a human. </p> <p>So it's practically setting us up to give it ultimate (ultron) power. </p> <p>Idk. Maybe I'm tripping.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Mlchzdk555"> /u/Mlchzdk555 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17isv84/developer_mode_random_promptthought/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17isv84/developer_mode_random_promptthought/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: 这篇文章讨论了使用AI pronpts生成有趣和幽默的动画短片的创意方面。作者提到了目前大多数AI内容生成器只能生成文本转语音视频，而且往往偏向商业和演示，或者用于制作点击率和信息性视频。作者还提到了AI图像生成器可以生成静态图像，但没有找到可以生成动画或视频格式的网站。作者希望能够利用AI来实现自己一直以来的梦想，创作自己的卡通作品。 </div>

More so I am interested in the creative aspect of using AI pronpts to generate interesting and humorous animated shorts. I feel like there is an opportunity here to simply put certain prompts in and experiment with generating very humorous or original animated content that would otherwise take a long time to animate yourself, or use claymation, etc.</p> <p>The problem I have is that most AI content generators, even if you have a paid membership, just generate text to speech videos with stock looking people or a AI generated people. It seems more business and presentation-oriented, or oriented towards creating clickbait or informative videos.</p> <p>I have come across AI image generators that will do what I'm talking about, create for example &quot;a giant rat eating a piece of cheese on the moon&quot; or whatever you want to imagine up, but it's only a still image. Are there any sites to do this in animated or video format?</p> <p>I've just always wanted to create my own cartoon and I feel like AI could be the way to go.</p> <p>Thank you</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Dropped10mmSocket"> /u/Dropped10mmSocket </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17ieusx/ai_video_generation_question_tired_of/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17ieusx/ai_video_generation_question_tired_of/">[comments]</a></span>
