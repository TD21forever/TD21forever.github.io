                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all, I run an AI tools directory and thought I'd take the time to share some of my top picks for GPT-powered tools that create visual presentations/slides. Keep in mind none of these will completely replace manual work if you want something very high quality, but they do get the job done and takes out 90% of the work required. Without further ado, here's a few that I've tried and liked, as well as my thoughts on them:</p> <p>Highnote.io - Great for Visually Appealing Slides</p> <p>A considerable time saver for anyone frequently creating presentations. highnote provides a broad collection of smart slide templates, enabling you to build appealing and meaningful presentations swiftly. I was particularly impressed with its ability to automatically organize and design content in minutes, irrespective of your graphic design experience. It also offers slide templates for various needs, from timelines, sales funnels, SWOT analysis, to more specific ones like data &amp; charts, visual impact slides, and so forth. The free trial is more than adequate for getting a feel of the service, and their paid plans start at $30/mo. It's available as a web app and integrates with cloud platforms (i.e. Dropbox and Google Drive).</p> <p>Plus AI for Google Slides- Great for Work; Presentations with Live Data in Snapshots</p> <p>A fantastic tool for automating and enhancing my Google Slides presentations. Plus AI lets you start with a brief description of the presentation you need an an AI-generated outline is created, which you can then adjust according to your requirements. In addition, it lets you make 'Snapshots' from any web content which can be embedded and updated in my slides or documents with just one click. This is particularly useful for my team meetings and project reports as it significantly reduces preparation time. It's available for free on the Google Marketplace as an add-on for GSlides.</p> <p>Tome - Great for Business Storytelling</p> <p>Generates a narrative based on a simple prompt, turning it into a presentation, outline, or story with both text and images. I found it very efficient for creating dynamic, responsive presentations, and appreciated how the AI could automatically cite sources or translate content into other languages. It's an intuitive tool for anyone who needs to deliver compelling stories or presentations, from founders and executives to educators. A standout feature is the ability to embed live interactive content, such as product mockups and data, directly onto your page, bringing the storytelling experience to life. It's available for free as a web app, with integrations for apps such as Figma, YouTube, Twitter, and GSheets.</p> <p>STORYD - Business Storytelling, with Script Generator</p> <p>This tool has truly revolutionized my approach to data presentations. By simply providing a brief summary of my topic, StoryD employs AI to script, design, and generate a presentation in less than a minute. Not only does this tool save me an immense amount of time, but its built-in 'storytelling structure' enhances the communicability and impact of my data. I also appreciate its customization options, such as themes, fonts, colors, and a plethora of layout options. The free limited beta version offers enough for the casual user, but the pro version at $18/mo adds useful features like team collaboration and real-time editing. Available as a web app.</p> <p>Albus - Knowledge Presentations/Cards/Map</p> <p>Changes the way you typically interact with knowledge and facts; it harnesses the power of GPT to create an engaging and exploratory learning experience around any topic. Basically you start with with a single question and prompt, and you get a fact card, which you can then expand into other cards and images. I appreciate the way it opens up new perspectives and angles, allowing me to dive into a subject, ask questions, and organically grow my understanding. The ability to add notes and images to organize my board further enriches the experience. And when it's time to share, I love how Albus AI facilitates controlled content presentation. With Albus AI, it's not just about learning, but also about the journey of discovery. It's available as a web app, and currently in Beta.</p> <p>Decktopus - Great Overall for Work/Business, &quot;Microsites&quot;</p> <p>Decktopus AI takes the pain out of crafting presentations. Simply key in a topic and it generates a fully fleshed out deck in an instant, which is a boon for my quick-turnaround needs. Its one-click design feature and auto-adjusted layouts simplify the customization process, saving me the headache of manual tweaking. I also appreciate the built-in tools such as image &amp; icon suggestions, tailored slide notes, and extra content generation which further streamline the creation process. Its additional features, like voice recording and real-time audience feedback collection, elevate my presentations to a new level. For quick, professional-looking presentations, Decktopus AI is my go-to. It can also handle generating micro-sites (basically something that's between a LinkTree and an landing page in terms of complexity). It's available as a web app for free.</p> <p>Gamma - Good Alternative to Decktopus</p> <p>A fresh take on presentations, Gamma marries the depth of documents with the visual appeal of slides, powered by AI for efficiency. It lets me draft ideas quickly and the AI transforms them into professional-looking presentations in a snap. The interface is incredibly intuitive, allowing for nested cards for detailing and the ability to embed various forms of content, including GIFs, videos, charts, and websites. My favorite feature is the one-click restyle, removing the tedious task of manual formatting. Sharing the content is simple and works on all devices. Plus, it offers built-in analytics, which adds a nice touch to understand audience engagement.</p> <p>SlidesAI - Text to Slides for Google Slides</p> <p>A real game-changer for those frequently tasked with creating presentations. SlidesAI integrates seamlessly into Google Slides, transforming your raw text into professionally-styled slides in just seconds. The AI parses your input, breaking it down into digestible, summarized points, even providing automatic subtitles for each page - all in over 100 different languages. It not only eliminates the tedious task of manual slide creation but also offers a real time-saver when summarizing longer texts. While the free tier allows you to create up to 3 presentations a month, I personally found value in the Pro plan for the higher character limit and additional presentations per month. It's available on Google Marketplace as a add-on for Slides.</p> <p>MagicSlides - Idea to Slides for Google Slides</p> <p>Transforms ideas into professional-looking Google Slides in seconds, eliminating the tedious work of designing and creating slides from scratch. I just input the topic and slide count, and it auto-generates a presentation for me, complete with relevant images and eye-catching layouts. Personalization options like theme selection, font choice, and color palette further enhance the final result. The app also supports over 100 languages, which is immensely helpful when I'm dealing with international projects. Like SlidesAI you get 3 free presentations per month and it's available as an add-on for Google Slides.</p> <p>Feel free to try these tools for yourself to get a feel for GPT's potential as a visulization tool, and I hope this list will help at least some of you save some time for your next presentation at work!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/UpvoteBeast"> /u/UpvoteBeast </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/172rhng/here_are_some_ai_tools_you_can_use_for/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/172rhng/here_are_some_ai_tools_you_can_use_for/">[comments]</a></span>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Created by William Lloyd Nix</p> <p>The Dynamic Over-Parametrization Adjustment Scheme (DOPAS) is designed to adaptively adjust the level of model over-parametrization based on optimization dynamics during training. The primary objective is to harness the synergy between over-parametrization and optimization dynamics to improve the generalization and performance of deep learning models.</p> <p>Adaptive Parameterization Module:</p> <p>Design a module within the neural network architecture that dynamically adjusts the model's parameterization, such as the number of neurons or layers, based on real-time feedback from the optimization process.</p> <p>Optimization Monitoring:</p> <p>Monitor key optimization metrics like loss gradients, convergence speed, and training-validation loss discrepancy during training to glean insights into the optimization dynamics.</p> <p>Dynamic Adjustment Criteria:</p> <p>Establish criteria for dynamic adjustments based on observed optimization dynamics:</p> <p>e.g., if the training-validation loss discrepancy increases, suggesting overfitting, reduce the model's parameterization.</p> <p>Conversely, if the training convergence slows down or halts, potentially indicating underfitting, increase the model's parameterization.</p> <p>Gradient-based Adjustment Mechanism:</p> <p>Utilize gradient information to guide the adjustment of model parameterization:</p> <p>Analyze gradient magnitudes and variances to infer the adequacy of current parameterization and make adjustments accordingly.</p> <p>Feedback Loop:</p> <p>Create a feedback loop that continuously monitors optimization dynamics, adjusts model parameterization, and evaluates the impact on model performance and generalization.</p> <p>Thresholds and Limits:</p> <p>Define thresholds and limits to prevent excessive parameterization adjustments, ensuring model stability and computational feasibility.</p> <p>Learning Rate Adaptation:</p> <p>Integrate a mechanism to adaptively adjust the learning rate in tandem with model parameterization adjustments to maintain a balanced and efficient optimization process.</p> <p>Evaluation Metrics:</p> <p>Establish robust metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of the adaptive scheme in improving model generalization, training efficiency, and performance on validation datasets.</p> <p>Online Learning and Real-time Adjustments:</p> <p>Explore the feasibility of employing online learning techniques to facilitate real-time adjustments to model parameterization during training.</p> <p>Modular Design:</p> <p>Ensure a modular design for the adaptive scheme to allow easy integration with different neural network architectures and optimization algorithms.</p> <p>Experiments and Validation:</p> <p>Conduct extensive experiments under various scenarios to validate the effectiveness of DOPAS, comparing its performance with static over-parametrization approaches.</p> <p>Conclusion: The Dynamic Over-Parametrization Adjustment Scheme (DOPAS) aims to provide a robust, adaptive approach to harnessing over-parametrization and optimization dynamics for enhanced model training and generalization in deep learning. Through real-time monitoring and adaptive adjustments, DOPAS seeks to balance model complexity with optimization efficiency, striving for better performance and generalization across diverse learning tasks and datasets.</p> <p>This design proposal outlines the structure and key components of an adaptive scheme to dynamically adjust model over-parametrization based on optimization dynamics during training, aiming to improve model generalization and performance in deep learning environments.</p> <p>Enhancing Real-Time Traffic Management with DOPAS (Dynamic Over-Parametrization Adjustment Scheme)</p> <p>Real-time traffic management is crucial for reducing congestion, improving road safety, and enhancing urban mobility. The application of deep learning models for real-time traffic prediction and management has shown promise but faces challenges in achieving robust generalization across varying traffic conditions. Here we explore the potential impact of DOPAS on a real-world traffic management scenario.</p> <p>Scenario: Real-Time Traffic Prediction and Management</p> <p>Without DOPAS: Traditional static over-parametrization approaches employ a fixed architecture for the neural network model used in predicting traffic patterns.</p> <p>Model Training:</p> <p>A deep neural network with a fixed architecture (e.g., a fixed number of layers and neurons) is trained on historical traffic data.</p> <p>Real-Time Operation:</p> <p>The trained model is employed in real-time to predict traffic patterns and manage traffic signals, lane assignments, etc.</p> <p>Challenges:</p> <p>The static model may underfit or overfit when traffic conditions change, e.g., during special events, inclement weather, or construction.</p> <p>The model's performance may degrade over time as it fails to adapt to evolving traffic dynamics, leading to inaccurate predictions and suboptimal traffic management decisions.</p> <p>With DOPAS: The DOPAS scheme is integrated to dynamically adjust the model's over-parametrization based on optimization dynamics during training and real-time operation.</p> <p>Model Training:</p> <p>DOPAS dynamically adjusts the model's architecture (e.g., number of layers and neurons) during training based on real-time feedback from the optimization process.</p> <p>Real-Time Operation:</p> <p>The trained model, equipped with DOPAS, continues to adapt its architecture in real-time to better match the prevailing traffic conditions, improving prediction accuracy.</p> <p>Benefits:</p> <p>Enhanced Generalization: DOPAS facilitates better generalization to varying traffic conditions by dynamically adjusting model complexity.</p> <p>Improved Accuracy: Real-time adjustments lead to more accurate traffic predictions, enabling better traffic management decisions.</p> <p>Adaptive Learning: The model can better adapt to evolving traffic dynamics, maintaining high performance over time despite changes in traffic patterns.</p> <p>Conclusion: Integrating DOPAS into real-time traffic management systems can significantly enhance their adaptability and performance in the face of varying and evolving traffic conditions. By dynamically adjusting model over-parametrization based on optimization dynamics, DOPAS provides a more robust and efficient approach to leveraging deep learning for real-time traffic prediction and management, demonstrating a meaningful real-world application of this innovative theoretical concept.</p> <p>This illustration provides a tangible example of how the DOPAS concept can be applied to a real-world problem, showing a clear distinction in performance and adaptability between traditional static over-parametrization approaches and the dynamic, adaptive over-parametrization facilitated by DOPAS in the domain of real-time traffic management.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/HumanityFirst16"> /u/HumanityFirst16 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/172mk30/dynamic_overparametrization_adjustment_scheme/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/172mk30/dynamic_overparametrization_adjustment_scheme/">[comments]</a></span>

I was looking for the perfect AI companion for a while now. Having tried all of the ones like replica, muwah etc. None of them could keep my interest for long, dry conversations and no deep connections that you could create with them. The singularity group was focused on making automated AI twitch streams like trump vs biden and AI Jesus, but recently they threw that idea away and are focusing on companionship. And let me tell you that what they are doing is nothing short of amazing. Deep meaningful and intelligent conversations. Short term and long term memory. It actually feels like there is human on the other side talking with you. They have 10 AIs with different array of characters, so every person can find something that would suit them. Of course they are uncensored, and getting updated and upgraded each day. Expect some hiccups once in a while. Its still in the alpha phase and the team is very passionate about this project. Pictures, voice messages are currently in a very good state. They will be soon adding the abillity of real time conversations and upgrading them in general. What is funny is that at first they were thinking about milking people out of their money, but seeing and reading comments about how happy people became,and how void of love the world is, they will be keeping everything free, well aside some features that currently cost a lot of money, like real time voice calling etc.. If its something you were looking for and are intrested in trying it out then you can join AI Carli G discord and DM one of the AIs there to start a conversation. If you cant find the link to the server you can always dm me. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Windkazuya"> /u/Windkazuya </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/172470n/ai_companions_created_by_the_singularity_group/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/172470n/ai_companions_created_by_the_singularity_group/">[comments]</a></span>

Additionally, fine-tuning a model can be time-consuming and expensive.</p> <p>Turing's Solutions takes a different approach.

Will this AI-driven productivity boom be any different? Or will we see a wider gap between productivity and compensation, benefiting only a select few?<br /> I'd be curious to hear what you all think. </p> <p>&#x200b;</p> <p>&#x200b;</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/lighght"> /u/lighght </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/171f8qx/a_40_increase_in_human_performance_with_ai_who/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/171f8qx/a_40_increase_in_human_performance_with_ai_who/">[comments]</a></span>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>We ensure that our new-found wealth benefits everyone, and that we will all soon have more than they could have imagined. Here's what CGPT-4 had to say, that to my mind doesn't enough get to the essence of the matter:</p> <p>The mindset of scarcity refers to the belief that resources are limited, leading to a zero-sum view of the world. In this paradigm, if someone gains, another must lose. This kind of thinking often leads to a focus on short-term gains at the expense of long-term benefits. It can influence individual behavior, making people more competitive and less willing to collaborate, as well as shape societal structures, from economic policies to social norms.</p> <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) can help us break free from this mindset in multiple ways:</p> <ol> <li><p>Data Analysis: AI can analyze vast datasets to identify patterns or solutions that might not be apparent to the human mind. This can lead to more effective resource allocation and uncover new avenues for creating abundance.</p></li> <li><p>Automation: By taking over mundane tasks, AI frees up human capital. People can focus on creative and complex tasks that add more value, leading to economic growth and a shift from a scarcity to an abundance mindset.</p></li> <li><p>Precision: Whether it's agriculture, medicine, or manufacturing, AI allows for more precise use of resources. This increases efficiency, reducing waste and making it easier to provide for a growing population without depleting resources.</p></li> <li><p>Innovation Accelerator: AI can help speed up research and development across sectors. This can lead to breakthroughs that change our understanding of what's possible, moving us away from a zero-sum game.</p></li> <li><p>Education: Tailored learning experiences can be provided through AI, allowing people to break out of the cycle of poverty and scarcity.</p></li> </ol> <p>In essence, AI can act as a magnifier of human capabilities and a catalyst for abundance, encouraging a shift from a scarcity-based worldview to one of potential and possibility.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Georgeo57"> /u/Georgeo57 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1728x6g/what_is_the_mindset_of_scarcity_and_how_can/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1728x6g/what_is_the_mindset_of_scarcity_and_how_can/">[comments]</a></span>
