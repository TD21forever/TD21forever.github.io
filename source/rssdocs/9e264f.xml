总结: 这篇文章讨论了在大学课程中如何引入人工智能的话题。作者分享了自己教授的一门名为“数字人文导论”的课程，其中有几周的内容是关于人工智能的。起初，作者让学生们学习监督学习的基础知识，并尝试使用Google Experiments和Artbreeder等工具，讨论深度伪造等话题。然而，随着GPT-3和DALLE-E2的问世，这些工具显得过时了。作者希望得到一些能够引起学生兴趣的、有趣且易于上手的人工智能工具，而且这些工具需要免费或提供免费试用。此外，作者还表示对使用Google Colab笔记本进行轻度使用没有意见。总之，作者希望找到那些能够给学生们带来“哇”效果的工具，因为这些学生可能只对聊天机器人和新闻中关于人工智能的内容有所了解。 </div>

When I started teaching it, I had students learn the <a href="https://www.youtubeeducation.com/watch?v=4qVRBYAdLAo">basics of supervised</a> learning and play around with <a href="https://experiments.withgoogle.com/">Google Experiments</a> and <a href="https://www.artbreeder.com/">Artbreeder</a>, and talk about deep fakes and such. The goal was to find creative/fun test cases for AI while thinking lightly about the ethical and societal consequences and things like that.</p> <p>When GPT-3 and DALLE-E2 came out, though, most of those tools feel woefully out of date. Give me some of your favorite tools that make for fun, easy introductions to AI. Everything needs to be either free or available with a free trial. Light use of Google Colab notebooks would be okay, too. I'm mainly looking for things that have that &quot;wow&quot; factor for students who may only be familiar with chatbots and things they might see about AI in the news.

总结: 作为一个有趣的爱好项目，我想研究一下如何设置一个LLM（轻量级语言模型），可以对一段文本进行分析，判断其是否是标题党。我想输入一些类似于YouTube视频标题的字符串，其中大部分是低质量的垃圾内容，另外一些则是值得观看的内容，然后通过训练LLM，使其能够大致准确地标记它们，或者过滤掉低质量的内容。我对这个领域的最新进展不太了解，因为过去12个月我没有关注过任何相关信息。我最后一次使用LLM是在听到很多关于FLAN-T5的时候...我不确定现在哪些LLM非常流行，是否有一个小巧而好用的模型可以用于这个项目，而且训练时间不会太长。欢迎推荐！ </div>

I want to feed in a bunch of strings of things like youtube video titles, that would more or less be low quality garbage, and then separately a bunch that are worth watching, and be able to get it to a point where it marks them roughly accurately / can filter out the ones that are low quality. </p> <p>I haven't kept up with anything in this space in the last 12 or so months, so i'm not familiar with what has come out recently. Last I was playing with LLMS it was when I was hearing a lot about FLAN-T5... I'm not sure what LLM's are very popular right now and if there's a good small one i could use for this, which might not take a lot of time to train up. </p> <p>Recommendations welcome! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/NotARedditUser3"> /u/NotARedditUser3 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17k26wt/noob_seeking_recommendation_for_lightweight_llm/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17k26wt/noob_seeking_recommendation_for_lightweight_llm/">[comments]</a></span>

It can answer like ChatGPT, run on your desktop without the need to quantize, and outperform Llama2 70B.<br /> - Based on Mistral 7b, Zephyr-7B is a smaller language model that uses supervised distillation techniques and direct distilled preference optimization to improve intent alignment and achieve top-tier performance in chat benchmarks.</li> <li><strong>A model by Twelve Labs understands video</strong><br /> - It is announcing its latest video-language foundation model Pegasus-1 along with a new suite of Video-to-Text APIs. Contrary to existing solutions that either utilizes speech-to-text conversions or rely solely on visual frame data, Pegasus-1 integrates visual, audio, and speech information to generate more holistic text from videos.</li> <li><strong>ChatGPT Plus members can upload and analyze files in the latest beta</strong><br /> - Once a file is fed to ChatGPT, it takes a few moments to digest and then do things like summarize data, answer questions, or generate data visualizations based on prompts. It can chat with pdfs, data files, and other document types. Check out the other updates in the newsletter.</li> <li><strong>Google to invest $2 billion in Anthropic</strong><br /> - It invested $500 million upfront into Anthropic earlier and had agreed to add $1.5 billion more over time. The move follows Amazon’s commitment made last month to invest $4 billion in Anthropic.</li> <li><strong>WhatsApp is working on new AI support chatbot feature</strong><br /> - It will streamline in-app issue resolution without emailing. Whatsapp will respond in a chat with AI-generated messages and users will also be able to interact with manual chat support in a few taps. The feature will also resolve common issues and answer about WhatsApp features.</li> <li><strong>Perplexity announced two new models trained in-house, pplx-7b-chat and pplx-70b-chat</strong><br /> - Both models are built on top of open-source LLMs and are available as an alpha release, via Labs and pplx-api. The AI startup claims the models prioritize intelligence, usefulness, and versatility on an array of tasks, without imposing moral judgments or limitations.</li> <li><strong>Google Bard now responds in real time and you can cut off its response</strong><br /> - Bard previously only sent a response when it was complete, but now you can view a response as it’s getting generated. You can switch between “Respond in real time” and “Respond when complete”. Like ChaGPT, you can also cut off the bot mid-response.</li> <li><strong>Citibank to grant majority of its over 40,000 coders access to generative AI</strong><br /> - As part of a small pilot program, the Wall Street giant has quietly allowed about 250 of its developers to experiment with generative AI. Now, it’s planning to expand that program to the majority of its coders next year.</li> </ul> <p>More detailed breakdown of these news and innovations in the <a href="https://theaiedge.substack.com/p/hf-zephyr-7b-beta-open-source-gpt35-alternative">daily newsletter</a>.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RohitAkki"> /u/RohitAkki </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17jy4ut/twominute_daily_ai_update_date_10302023_news_from/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17jy4ut/twominute_daily_ai_update_date_10302023_news_from/">[comments]</a></span>
