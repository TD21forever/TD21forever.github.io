<br>
<br>
总结: Kadane's Sliding Window是一种用于大型语言模型的长期记忆窗口，可以解决语言模型短期记忆的限制。它可以与任何LLM模型结合使用，并且非常简单地添加到现有的模型架构中。通过使用Kadane's Sliding Window，LLM模型可以存储和访问过去的信息，即使这些信息不在当前给定的上下文中。 </div>
                        <hr>
                    
                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Yes, I am aware MemGPT exists. MemGPT is exactly why I am releasing Kadane's Sliding Window under an MIT Open-Source license. MemGPT only works with OpenAI. If you do not want to pay OpenAI money, you cannot use it. Kadane's Sliding Window is about 15 lines of Python code. You can slap this baby into whatever LLM model you would like to! </p> <p>I personally tested it out with a Phi-1.5 model. Works nice. Wrote me a nice and very long story about Alice in Wonderland. It stayed congruent with the story the entire time, because it had a context window that I fed it, that grew and grew as it spit out the story. It took about 10 seconds to set it up. </p> <p>Release Date: October 20, 2023</p> <p>License: MIT Open-Source</p> <p>Introduction</p> <p>Kadane's Sliding Window is a new long-term memory window for large language models (LLMs). It is adjustable to any length, depending on the size of the model and the limitations of the hardware. Kadane's Sliding Window is specifically designed to be used with any LLM model, and it is very simple to add to any existing model architecture.</p> <p>Motivation</p> <p>Kadane's algorithm has existed in computer science for a long time. Kadane's algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm for finding the maximum subarray of a given array. It is also particularly well-suited for tasks that involve finding patterns in sequences. It has one limitation; it is meant for unlimited arrays, but I want it for limited strings. So, 'Kadane's Sliding Window'. Ez Pz lemon squeezy.</p> <p>LLMs are powerful tools for generating text, translating languages, and answering questions in an informative way. However, they have one major limitation: they have a very short memory. This means that they can only remember the information that is contained in the context that they are given.Kadane's Sliding Window addresses this limitation by providing LLMs with a long-term memory window. This window allows LLMs to store and access information from the past, even if it is not explicitly included in the context that they are currently given.</p> <p>Implementation</p> <p>Kadane's Sliding Window is implemented as a queue. The queue is initialized with a maximum length, which is determined by the size of the model and the limitations of the hardware. As the model generates text, the tokens are added to the queue. When the queue reaches its maximum length, the oldest tokens are removed.</p> <p>To use Kadane's Sliding Window, simply add the following code to your existing LLM model architecture:</p> <p>Python</p> <p>class KadaneSlidingWindow:</p> <p>def __init__(self, maxlen):</p> <p>self.maxlen = maxlen</p> <p>self.window = collections.deque()</p> <p>def add(self, elements):</p> <p>for element in elements:</p> <p>self.window.append(element)</p> <p>if len(self.window) &gt; self.maxlen:</p> <p>self.window.popleft()</p> <p>def get_context(self):</p> <p>return &quot; &quot;.join(self.window)</p> <p># Create a Kadane Sliding Window with a maximum length of 1000 tokens</p> <p>kadane_sliding_window = KadaneSlidingWindow(maxlen=1000)</p> <p># Add the context to the sliding window</p> <p>kadane_sliding_window.add(context.split())</p> <p># Generate text using the LLM model</p> <p>output_ids = model.generate(input_ids=input_ids)</p> <p># Decode the generated text using the tokenizer</p> <p>generated_text = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)</p> <p># Add the generated text to the sliding window</p> <p>kadane_sliding_window.add(generated_text.split())</p> <p>Benefits</p> <p>Kadane's Sliding Window offers a number of benefits for LLMs, including:</p> <p>Improved performance on tasks that require long-term memory, such as question answering and summarization.</p> <p>Increased creativity and diversity in generated text.</p> <p>Reduced need for human intervention, as the model can learn to perform tasks without being explicitly told what to do.</p> <p>Conclusion</p> <p>Kadane's Sliding Window is a powerful new tool for improving the performance of LLMs. It is simple to implement and can be used with any LLM model architecture. Kadane's Sliding Window is released under an MIT Open-Source License, so anyone can use it to improve their own LLMs.</p> <p><a href="https://turingssolutions.com/f/kadanes-sliding-window-unlimited-memory-for-any-llm-model">Release Article Contains GitHub Link</a></p> <p>Here is almost my full code from playing around with it:</p> <p>import collections</p> <p>import torch</p> <p>from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer</p> <p>class KadaneSlidingWindow:</p> <p>def __init__(self, maxlen):</p> <p>self.maxlen = maxlen</p> <p>self.window = collections.deque()</p> <p>self.long_term_memory = []</p> <p>def add(self, elements):</p> <p>for element in elements:</p> <p>self.window.append(element)</p> <p>self.long_term_memory.append(element)</p> <p>if len(self.window) &gt; self.maxlen:</p> <p>self.window.popleft()</p> <p>def get_context(self):</p> <p>return &quot; &quot;.join(self.window)</p> <p># Create a Kadane Sliding Window with a size of 1000 tokens</p> <p>kadane_sliding_window = KadaneSlidingWindow(maxlen=1000)</p> <p># Initialize the Phi-1.5 model</p> <p>model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(&quot;microsoft/phi-1_5&quot;, trust_remote_code=True, torch_dtype=&quot;auto&quot;)</p> <p>tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(&quot;microsoft/phi-1_5&quot;, trust_remote_code=True, torch_dtype=&quot;auto&quot;)</p> <p># Generate text with the Phi-1.5 model and the Kadane Sliding Window</p> <p>prompt = &quot;Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Alice who lived in a small village.

On the other hand, it poses a significant threat to publishers who depend on click-throughs for revenue and look for essential recognition.</p> <p><strong>The dilemma here is stark:</strong> allow Google to summarize your content and risk losing recognition and traffic, or opt-out and lose visibility on the web almost completely! It's like being caught between a rock and a hard place.</p> <p>So, what can publishers do to protect their interests? Here are some strategies from my understanding:</p> <p>- Optimize for Snippets - If Google is going to summarize your content, make sure it's your best content displayed and your references get included in the summaries. Use SEO strategies to optimize for featured snippets and summaries and make the most of this chance!</p> <p>- Diversify Revenue Streams - Don't put all your eggs in the Google basket. Explore other revenue-generating avenues like subscriptions, sponsored content, and merchandise.</p> <p>- Engage Directly with Your Audience - Use social media and newsletters to build a loyal community. Direct engagement can help you create an alternative route to reach your audience.</p> <p>- Collaborate and Advocate - Team up with other publishers to advocate for fair practices. There's strength in numbers.</p> <p>Having a progressive mindset to evolve with changes while striving for an equitable middle ground often the best way ahead in the dynamic digital era, but how can this be implemented by publishers in your opinion? </p> <p>Is this actually an SEO opportunity in disguise for those who can create the most helpful and summarizable content?</p> <p>Let's discuss!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/vikas_agrawal77"> /u/vikas_agrawal77 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17cyacd/googles_ai_summary_feature_has_publishers_in_a/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17cyacd/googles_ai_summary_feature_has_publishers_in_a/">[comments]</a></span>

<br>
总结: 在人工智能领域，LLM/GAI/RAAI等技术备受瞩目，但从作者的角度来看，这种技术并不能完全满足企业的需求。尽管LLM在构建认知自动化应用方面非常强大，但企业仍应该根据自身的知识产权和企业级数据开发自己的模型。作者认为，传统模型构建与LLM的结合是有必要的，通过将精确预测或结果添加到LLM请求中，可以更好地满足企业的需求。 </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Here is the background. At my job the past couple of months we have pivoted to all things LLM/GAI/RAAI. My background is in AI and cognitive automation. The hype in our world is beyond reproach. It gives me pause in certain aspects. Some (hell most) of the hype is coming directly from the big 3 cloud vendors. </p> <p>Here is the rub. It seems to be that behind the scenes from the top down (execs) it is being said that LLM's are the end-all of anything and everything one needs for their artificial intelligence needs. </p> <p>As an exec and engineer (I still write my own code and models) I can unequivocally say this is bullshit. LLM's are great but they don't know your proprietary data. They can't. In fact, if all your corporate enterprise data is already inside of GPT I can surmise you don't have a very innovative platform. If your secret sauce is already in the LLM that should be a concern for you. </p> <p>Don't get me wrong, ChatGPT and LLM's are amazing and I have made a living from building cognitive automation applications. So I get the power and strength of LLM's. However, the ability to develop your own model based on your IP/enterprise level data is something you should still be doing. </p> <p>However, the obvious synergy that could come from custom model building coinciding with your LLM pipeline is not happening. I'll get into this more later. </p> <p>What is happening is this, the business and low code fanatics which are always on the business side want to will into existence that custom models are not the way to go and just use LLM for everything and anything. This infuriates me. </p> <p>Some of the attitude is justified and I know where it comes from. Years of data scientists over promising and under delivering. Models that are just worthless in some respects.</p> <p>Here's how I see it. Why can't there be both working together. In one of the most memorable and best episodes of &quot;House of Lies&quot;, the awkward Doug Guggenheim is in the spotlight, prepping for a TED talk. While his colleagues anticipate a comedic disaster, but he surprises everyone. Drawing inspiration from Dungeons &amp; Dragons, he eloquently discusses orcs and the untapped strength in collaboration. This unconventional wisdom resonates deeply, especially with a profoundly high Marty Kaan, leading him to a groundbreaking idea: the fledgling marijuana industry could greatly benefit from partnering with big tobacco.</p> <p>Why can't we have this with AI/ML in a traditional model building sense coinciding with LLM's? From my work with LLM's I see the obvious need for this. Give me a model that might be fine tuned, delivers a decision tree or random forest result from proprietary data that can then be fed into the LLM's 0 / some shot formality. </p> <p>We have done this in POC's and pilots and it works so well. You do something that results in a precise prediction or result and then you add that into your prompt and LLM request. This results in less hallucinations and more of a consistent result from the LLM. </p> <p>Why aren't we working with the Orcs instead of saying that it should only be this one way. Am I wrong? I don't think so but I'd like to see what others think. If it is a good approach how can it be communicated that this approach is necessary. </p> <p>Why am I ranting about this. Because as we ask for more data we to build custom models there is pushback and the business approach of just shove this into the LLM see it works sometimes and GPT knows this. lol huh? where did you get that information about that one single case? imagine scaling that. You can't be serious. I digress. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Xtianus21"> /u/Xtianus21 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17cpk0i/llm_vs_traditional_model_building_vs_model/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17cpk0i/llm_vs_traditional_model_building_vs_model/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: 研究人员提出了一种名为3D-GPT的新型AI系统，它通过结合自然语言指令和专门用于处理现有3D建模工具的代理来创建3D模型。3D-GPT具有预定义的函数来生成3D形状，并通过调整参数来构建场景。关键是让AI理解指令并选择正确的工具。通过将建模工作分解为步骤，代理可以协作匹配描述，类似于人类3D建模团队的工作方式。然而，该系统存在一些限制，如依赖现有生成器、细节和曲线的不确定性以及对默认形状的过度依赖。尽管如此，该代理架构显示出一定的规划能力，未来可能扩展到更具创造性的任务。 </div>

The key is getting the AI to understand instructions and pick the right tools.</p> <p>It has three main agents:</p> <ul> <li><strong>A dispatcher</strong> that parses the text and picks generation functions</li> <li><strong>A conceptualizer</strong> that adds details missing from the description</li> <li><strong>A modeler</strong> that sets parameters and outputs code to drive 3D software</li> </ul> <p>By breaking modeling work down into steps, the agents can collab to match the descriptions. This is sort of like how a 3D modeling team of humans would work.</p> <p>The paper authors show it making simple scenes like &quot;lush meadow with flowers&quot; that fit the text. It also modifies scenes appropriately when given new instructions. I include some gifs of example outputs in my full summary. They look pretty good - I would say 2005-quality graphics.</p> <p>There are limits. It fully relies on existing generators, so quality is capped. Details and curves are iffy. It resorts to default shapes often instead of true understanding. And I doubt the verts and textures are well-optimized.</p> <p>The agent architecture seems to be really popular right now. This one shows some planning skills, which could extend to more creative tasks someday.</p> <p><strong>TLDR:</strong> <strong>AI agents can team up to generate 3D models from text instructions.
