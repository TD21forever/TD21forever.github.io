That is: How fast can it teach itself. None of the limitations are an impediment once it can start learning by itself how to overcome it them. I am not an expert by any means in AI but even the sheer processing power to try 1 million things in 1 second it daunting. We can't oversee that without other AI's. </p> <p>The best analogy that comes to mind is that is very hard to burn a house down in 1 minute, possible but it would take a lot of resources and planning. But if you start with a small fire, it will grow exponentially with time and it will become a major fire eventually.</p> <p>Thank you to all who have been commenting here.

AI is already integrated into Apple products, such as the Apple Watch's Fall Detection and Crash Detection features.<br /> - Apple is planning to upgrade its search engine in the App Store and potentially develop a Google competitor &quot;Pegasus&quot;. Its being integrated into iOS and macOS, with the possibility of using gen AI tools to enhance it further.<br /> - Apple's Spotlight search feature already allows users to search for web results, app details, and documents. </li> <li><strong>Humane Inc has unveiled its first AI device, ‘Humane Ai Pin’</strong><br /> - The device uses sensors for natural and intuitive interactions. It does not need to be paired with a smartphone and features AI-powered optical recognition and a laser-projected display.<br /> - The full capabilities of the Humane Ai Pin will be revealed on November 9. </li> <li><strong>OpenAI’s DALL-E 3 is now publicly available on Bing for free</strong><br /> - The previous technology preview of DALL-E lacked protections against malicious use, but DALL-E 3 has implemented guardrails. Paid customers of OpenAI's ChatGPT Plus and Enterprise products are expected to get access first.</li> <li><strong>Google focuses more on AI in Pixel 8 phone</strong><br /> - A leaked Google ad showcases new AI features: Best Take, a feature that allows users to swap faces into images from other pictures.<br /> - The Pixel 8 event is set to take place on October 4th, but there have already been numerous leaks about the phone.<br /> - The ad also highlights the process of transferring data to a Pixel 8 and mentions other AI features like Magic Eraser.</li> <li><strong>Google's Bard is set to introduce a new feature called &quot;Memory&quot;</strong><br /> - It will allow it to remember important details about users and personalize its responses. Currently, each conversation with Bard starts from scratch, but with Memory, the AI will be able to account for specific details shared by users and use them to improve future results. </li> <li><strong>Wikipedia testing an AI-powered ChatGPT Plus plugin</strong><br /> - To improve knowledge access on the platform. The plugin searches and summarizes Wikipedia information for user queries, aiming to enhance user engagement and content quality.<br /> - The foundation hopes to gauge user engagement, potential contributors, and AI content quality through this initiative. This effort is part of its Annual Plan to enhance access to free knowledge on Wikipedia by facilitating the connection between readers and editors.</li> <li><strong>Walmart helping shoppers with AI</strong><br /> - AI can help customers visualize products in their homes or on their bodies, as well as provide recommendations for products. It also help in creating three-dimensional objects from still photos, saving time and money in the creation process. Walmart is open to using different AI technologies and aims to be neutral in its approach. The company has been using chatbots for customer service and transactions since 2020.</li> </ul> <p>More detailed breakdown of these news and innovations in the <a href="https://theaiedge.substack.com/p/apple-chatgpt-ai-bing-googlepixel8-googlebard">daily newsletter</a>.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RohitAkki"> /u/RohitAkki </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/16xwbex/twominute_daily_ai_update_date_10022023_news_from/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/16xwbex/twominute_daily_ai_update_date_10022023_news_from/">[comments]</a></span>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>When trying to get language models to solve complex math problems, researchers kept running into limits. Models like GPT-3 and ChatGPT still struggle with advanced algebra, calculus, and geometry questions. The math is just too abstract and symbol-heavy for them.</p> <p>To break through this barrier, researchers from Tsinghua University and Microsoft taught models to combine natural language reasoning with calling external math tools.</p> <p>The key is their new &quot;tool-integrated reasoning&quot; format. Models generate a natural language plan first, then write code to invoke tools like SymPy to solve equations. They take the output results and continue verbal reasoning.</p> <p>By interleaving natural language and symbolic computations, they get the best of both worlds - semantic understanding from language models and rigorous math from tools.</p> <p>They trained versions of the LLaMA model this way, producing their Tool-Integrated Reasoning Agent (TORA). They present some strong results:</p> <ul> <li>In evaluations on 10 math datasets, TORA substantially outperformed prior state-of-the-art methods, achieving 13-19% higher accuracy on average.</li> <li>On one competition test, TORA-7B scored 40% accuracy, beating the previous best model by 22 percentage points.</li> </ul> <p>This demonstrates that integrating tools directly into the reasoning process can significantly enhance mathematical capabilities, even for large models like GPT-4.</p> <p>However, tough problems involving geometry and advanced algebra are still there. New techniques for symbolic reasoning and spatial understanding will likely be needed to push further.</p> <p>Overall though, tool integration seems a promising path to improve reasoning skills. Applying this to other domains like logic and programming could also be impactful.</p> <p><strong>TLDR:</strong> Teaching language models to use math tools helps them solve way more complex problems.</p> <p><a href="https://notes.aimodels.fyi/researchers-announce-tora-training-language-models-to-better-understand-math-using-external-tools/"><strong>Full Paper Summary</strong></a></p> <p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.17452.pdf"><strong>arXiv Link</strong></a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Successful-Western27"> /u/Successful-Western27 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/16y16et/new_research_teaching_llms_to_use_math_tools/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/16y16et/new_research_teaching_llms_to_use_math_tools/">[comments]</a></span>

EasyVid adds voiceovers, subtitles, music, and background visuals automatically. All you need to do is enter a script and EasyVid does the rest :)</p> <p><strong>What is EasyVid?</strong></p> <p>EasyVid started as an experiment to see if I could use AI to automatically generate Youtube videos. After a weekend of coding, I created an automated Youtube channel. A few months ago I posted some of my videos to Reddit and I got a bunch of requests for the tool. So I decided to develop it further and make it publicly available!</p> <p><strong>Who am I?</strong></p> <p>I'm the solo developer for EasyVid. It's a side project and it's been very exciting building everything myself. I have learned a lot so far and the journey is just getting started :)</p> <p><strong>How to use EasyVid</strong></p> <p>I wanted to make it as easy as possible to make videos (hence the name), so it's just 3 steps:</p> <ol> <li>Type or paste in your script</li> <li>Adjust any settings (voice, language, aspect ratio, etc.)</li> <li>Click &quot;Generate video&quot;</li> </ol> <p>A few minutes later, you'll get a full video (.mp4 file) with an AI voiceover, automatic subtitles, AI-generated background visuals, and music!</p> <p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p> <p>- <strong>Voiceover:</strong> A narrator reads out your script with a very realistic, humanlike voice. I'm using Elevenlabs for text-to-speech and it's been really good! They seem to have the best audio quality by far compared to any other competitors at the moment.</p> <p>- <strong>Subtitles:</strong> These are automatically generated from the script and lined up with the audio. No AI here really but many people ask about this step. </p> <p>- <strong>Background Visuals:</strong> This tool generates background images using Stable Diffusion, an AI image generator. The images are custom prompted to match the content of the script. This makes it useful for creative video styles like stories and poems. I am really looking forward to DALLE-3 however and will likely switch once they make the API available!</p> <p>After everything is generated, it all gets stitched together and saved to a .mp4 file, ready to download!</p> <p><strong>Free to try</strong></p> <p>Everyone gets 40 seconds of video free on the house :) I wish I could provide more for free but the API costs are quite significant.</p> <p><strong>Only pay for what you use. No subscriptions</strong></p> <p>I'm not a fan of subscriptions either. So instead of a monthly subscription, &quot;Seconds packs&quot; are available to refill seconds when you need them.</p> <p><strong>Wait... Aren't AI generated videos usually garbage?</strong></p> <p>I'm optimistic that we can use AI to create high-quality content that provides real value to viewers. That's why my primary goal is to continue to improve the quality of the output videos. It's clear there's still plenty of room for improvement with the scripts, images and voice quality, but I think the quality is often surprisingly good! And of course, AI tools are getting better, cheaper, and faster each day, and that will lead to automatic improvements to video quality over time.</p> <p><strong>What do you think of AI generated videos? Will tools like EasyVid lead to a good future or will it cause more harm than good?</strong></p> <p>I've received both positive and negative responses from various communities on Reddit when posting about AI generated videos and I'm open to your respectful, constructive criticism. My mind is open because the AI landscape is changing so rapidly, it would be stupid to remain stubborn! Please share your thoughts, I would love to hear what you think! </p> <p><strong>TLDR:</strong><br /> Make videos with AI in a single click based on a simple text prompt.

This didn't make sense since the models should focus on foreground objects.</p> <p>By analyzing the output embeddings, they found a small number of tokens (2%) had super high vector norms, causing the spikes.</p> <p>The high-norm &quot;outlier&quot; tokens occurred in redundant areas and held less local info but more global info about the image.</p> <p>Their hypothesis is that ViTs learn to identify unimportant patches and recycle them as temporary storage instead of discarding.
