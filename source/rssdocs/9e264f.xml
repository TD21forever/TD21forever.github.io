While both have control over the aircraft, their priorities differ. The AI steps in when the human is distracted or misses important details.</p> <p>To gauge attention, the system uses eye-tracking for humans and &quot;saliency maps&quot; for the AI to identify where attention is focused in the brain. These maps act as visual guides to emphasize critical areas, allowing for early threat detection.</p> <p>The system has been tested in real-world scenarios, with promising results. It improves navigation success rates and reduces flight risks. Researchers envision its potential application in various fields beyond aviation, such as automobiles, drones, and robotics.</p> <p>This innovative technology demonstrates how AI can complement human capabilities, making air travel safer and more efficient. Further refinements are needed for widespread use, but the potential impact is significant.

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Yes, some people in the US are still afraid to go out. According to a recent poll by the Pew Research Center, 25% of US adults say they are afraid or very afraid of being attacked in their neighborhood. This is down from 30% in 2021, but it is still significantly higher than the pre-pandemic level of 18% in 2020.</p> <p>There are a number of reasons why people may be afraid to go out. Some people may be worried about contracting COVID-19, even though vaccination rates are high and the virus is less deadly than it was at the start of the pandemic. Others may be anxious about being in crowds or being in public places where they cannot control their environment. Still others may be worried about encountering violence or social unrest, especially in the wake of the January 6th insurrection.</p> <p>The fear of going out can have a significant impact on people's lives. It can make it difficult to go to work, school, or social events. It can also lead to isolation and loneliness.</p> <p>If you are struggling with the fear of going out, there are a number of things you can do to cope. Some helpful tips include:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Start slowly.</strong> If you haven't been out much in a while, start by going out for short periods of time and gradually increase the amount of time you spend away from home.</li> <li><strong>Choose familiar places.</strong> Start by going to places that you know and feel comfortable in.</li> <li><strong>Go with someone else.</strong> If you feel more comfortable, go out with a friend or family member.</li> <li><strong>Take breaks.</strong> If you start to feel anxious, take a break and go back to a place where you feel safe.</li> </ul> <p>If you are struggling to cope with the fear of going out on your own, consider talking to a therapist or counselor. They can help you to understand your anxiety and develop coping mechanisms.</p> <p>It is important to note that the fear of going out is a normal reaction to the unusual and stressful events that we have experienced in recent years. It is important to be patient with yourself and to seek help if you need it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Georgeo57"> /u/Georgeo57 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/170p4df/bard_are_people_in_the_us_still_afraid_to_go_out/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/170p4df/bard_are_people_in_the_us_still_afraid_to_go_out/">[comments]</a></span>

<br>
<br>
总结: 这篇论文研究了LLMs在自我纠错方面的能力，结果显示LLMs在推理任务的自我纠正上存在困难。核心问题在于LLMs难以可靠地评估自己回答的正确性，很少能够发现初始推理中的缺陷。有时，LLMs甚至在自我纠正后将初始正确的回答改为不正确的回答。然而，对于使回答更礼貌或更安全等方面，自我纠正显示出潜力。作者认为我们需要在对自我纠正的热情和现实期望之间取得平衡，通过引入高质量的人类反馈、训练数据和工具等方式，可能有助于实现自我纠正的潜力。 </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Can LLMs actually improve their own reasoning by self-correcting mistakes? A new paper from DeepMind and the University of Illinois looks to answer this quantitatively.</p> <p>The results show that unaided, LLMs struggle at self-correction for reasoning tasks. The core issue is LLMs have trouble reliably evaluating the correctness of their own responses. They rarely identify flaws in initial reasoning. Sometimes LLMs even alter initially correct responses to become incorrect after self-correction! <em>(I've personally seen this when interacting with ChatGPT many times and you probably have too).</em></p> <p>More complex techniques like critiquing between LLM instances don't help much either. External feedback or guidance looks necessary to improve reasoning (Well, some interesting parallels to this paper <a href="https://notes.aimodels.fyi/enabling-language-models-to-implicitly-learn-self-improvement/">here</a> about implicit improvement from preference data vs traditional RLHF).</p> <p>Self-correction does show promise for things like making responses more polite or safe though. Criteria there are more clear-cut.</p> <p>The authors argue we need to balance enthusiasm with realistic expectations on self-correction. It has a lot of limits for improving reasoning (at least with current models). But they suggest promising directions like incorporating high-quality external feedback from humans, training data, and tools. That could be key to unlocking self-correction's potential down the road.</p> <p><strong>TLDR: Basically title... LLMs can't reliably self-correct reasoning yet.</strong> Maybe hybrid techniques combining self-correction with external guidance could work but we need more research.</p> <p><a href="https://notes.aimodels.fyi/can-large-language-models-self-correct-their-own-reasoning-a-critical-look-at-the-promise-and-limits-of-self-correction/"><strong>Full summary</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Paper is <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01798.pdf"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Successful-Western27"> /u/Successful-Western27 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/170m0lj/deepmind_univ_of_illinois_is_selfcorrection_a/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/170m0lj/deepmind_univ_of_illinois_is_selfcorrection_a/">[comments]</a></span>

Soooo here i am, with no knowledge on AI websites and stuff. Can someone point me in the direction of how to get something like that made, so i can provide it to others?

<br>

总结: 最近我向人工智能提出了一个逻辑问题，A.I.提出了一个使用迭代过程解决问题的解决方案，类似于“高低猜测” - 这种方法需要大量的处理能力和内存，不断添加下一个迭代直到达到目标。然而，正确的解决方案是使用一个公式，只需要一个过程来完成任务。现在，考虑到这一点。神经网络使用了一种类似于“高低猜测”的反向传播系统，它通过增加权重来最终获得所需的结果。这需要大量的处理能力。那么现在想想，逻辑问题的正确解决方案是直接使用公式而不是迭代过程。是否可能存在一种神经网络可以使用的公式，而不是反向传播方法，以在不使用如此巨大的处理能力和内存的情况下获得所需的结果？（尚未发现的东西？）SQL数据库使用索引系统来加速数据搜索。还有一种与数组一起使用的二分搜索，可以减少处理时间。这是一个值得思考的问题。 </div>

The island, located 45 kilometers off the Belgian coast, will serve as an energy center connecting the country's onshore electricity system with new wind farms and interconnectors from the UK and Denmark. This initiative is part of Belgium's efforts to expand its offshore wind capacity and accelerate the energy transition. The island's construction will incorporate nature to protect marine and terrestrial wildlife, promoting biodiversity. It is expected to become an offshore wind energy hub and will commission its first wind turbines in 2028. The project aims to deliver additional offshore green energy while safeguarding protected marine areas. Construction is set to take approximately two years, from March 2024 to August 2026. </p> <p>Find out more at <a href="https://ie.social/eGmAL">https://ie.social/eGmAL</a> 🚀</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/intengineering"> /u/intengineering </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/170g8oz/worlds_first_artificial_intelligence_island/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/170g8oz/worlds_first_artificial_intelligence_island/">[comments]</a></span>
