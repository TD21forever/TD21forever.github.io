总结: 本文讲述了作者父亲因为阿尔茨海默病去世后，作者通过使用在线服务进行声音克隆，成功地再次听到了父亲的声音。作者对于声音克隆技术的存在感到兴奋，并认为这是一种帮助自己在悲痛过程中的祝福。 </div>
                        <hr>
                    
                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Disclaimer: I have no idea of the legality of cloning a deceased relative’s voice. Please check and adhere to the laws in your area. DYOR. </p> <p>My father passed away 2 years ago from Alzheimer’s. It was a terrible gradual decline and was heartbreaking to watch. </p> <p>One of the many things I miss is hearing his voice. It was a very calming, reassuring, and measured voice. Whenever I feel like I’m beginning to forget what his voice sound like, I play a short video I have on my phone of him telling my daughter a story from his childhood. </p> <p>Over the past year, I’ve been following all the developments in generative AI and stumbled upon an online service that lets you create a custom voice model from vocal samples you submit that the app processes into a cloned voice that you can then use it to convert text-to-speech.</p> <p>I know some folks out there might think this crosses some kind of ethical line, but my first thought upon hearing that this technology existed was “it sure would be cool to see if I could clone dad’s voice so I could hear him talk again”. This probably isn’t everyone’s first thought, maybe I’m weird for thinking of this, but I still wanted to try it anyways. </p> <p>To my surprise, the cloned voice models on the service aren’t robotic sounding at all, they can recreate vocal nuances, timbre, and cadence nearly perfectly. The more source material you feed the algorithm the better the results. I was fortunate enough to have a 3 minute video clip of my dad telling that story from his childhood which is what I fed into the algorithm. </p> <p>After paying a $1 to the service for a month of their “starter” plan (the minimum plan required to create a voice clone, I submitted the 3 minute audio sample of my dads voice, and a few minutes later, I had a scarily accurate clone of my dead father’s voice. When I say “scarily accurate”, I mean that it faithfully recreated many of his vocal nuances to a degree that fooled my entire family. Upon hearing it, they couldn’t believe it was a cloned voice and not some long lost recording of him. </p> <p>My family and I had a good cathartic cry upon hearing the results. I had his cloned voice read the Lord’s Prayer as well as ‘Twas the Night Before Christmas. Just hearing his simulated voice again is such a blessing and is helping me in the grief process.</p> <p>I tried to write out the process below in case anyone is curious: </p> <ol> <li><p>Go to <a href="https://elevenlabs.io">https://elevenlabs.io</a> and register for a “starter” account (the minimum level required to create a cloned voice). The cost is like $1 a month or something like that. </p></li> <li><p>Go to the “Voice Lab” section of the site </p></li> <li><p>Click the “+” button to “Add Generative or Cloned Voice” and choose the “Instant Voice Cloning” option.</p></li> <li><p>Name your voice and fill out the rest of the details.</p></li> <li><p>Upload video clips (containing audio) or other file types (MP3 files) containing audio samples of your loved one’s voice. For best results, you should try to make sure the clip contains audio of only their voice, edit out other people’s voices if possible. I downloaded a videos from Facebook and then used an MP4 to MP3 converter to strip out the video (since I didn’t need the video portion). This helps make the sample file smaller to avoid file upload limitations. </p></li> <li><p>Submit the samples and wait a few minutes for the service to build the voice clone.</p></li> <li><p>Once the voice is created, tap the “Use” button on the Voice Lab page or tap “Speech Synthesis” from the top-right menu and select the voice you just created. </p></li> <li><p>Type or Copy/Paste what you want the voice to say and tap “Generate” and wait until the text-to-speech conversion process is done.</p></li> <li><p>Press the play button to hear the cloned voice say what you typed and tap download and if you want to save it. </p></li> <li><p>If you want to adjust anything to try and make it sound better, tap the “Voice Settings” drop down menu and adjust the sliders. I raised the “Style Exaggeration” up to middle level and that seemed to really improve the believability of the voice for me. </p></li> </ol> <p>I know some people may judge me harshly for doing this and find this whole thing strange, morbid, disrespectful, or whatever, but I think it’s been good for my sisters and brothers and I at least to hear our dad’s voice again, even if it is just a simulation. It helps us to not forget what he sounded like. </p> <p>My future grandchildren will never know their great grandfather, but now, if I wanted to, I could use his voice to read them a story. This in some small way carries on his legacy and preserves his memory which I think he would appreciate.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Porespellar"> /u/Porespellar </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17a42xp/i_cloned_my_deceased_fathers_voice_using_ai_and/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17a42xp/i_cloned_my_deceased_fathers_voice_using_ai_and/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: 本文讨论了多层感知器（MLPs）的知识检验和编程实现。作者提到，MLPs中每个层之间的连接都有一组权重和偏差。对于没有隐藏层的全连接MLP网络，输入和输出节点之间的连接具有权重和偏差。而对于有一个隐藏层的全连接MLP网络，输入经过权重计算后传递给隐藏节点，然后再经过阈值计算传递给输出节点。作者推测，不同的权重层的数量应该是n-1。作者更关注的是从编程角度而非理论角度来看待这个问题。 </div>

总结: 如果LLMs能够如此准确地预测下一个单词或标记，那么它们是否也能够预测未来呢？假设它们可以访问网络并获取最新的新闻等信息，也许它们的预测能力可以描绘出人类世界接下来会发生的一些事情。即使只是稍微比50-50的概率更好地预测未来一两天的事件或决策，也足以改变社会和/或让某人赚大钱。也许我们从LLMs中看到的一些“幻觉”是对可能已经发生过的事情的一瞥...或者是对即将发生的事情的一瞥。 </div>

总结: 本文介绍了使用ChatGPT和LangChain来实现类似于Iron Man中Jarvis的人工智能系统的方法。为了使系统具有Jarvis的个性和语调，需要开发或获取一个能够模仿Jarvis的语气、声音和说话方式的文本转语音（TTS）和自然语言生成（NLG）系统。同时，还提到了Lifelong Learning Machines（LLMs）的概念。 </div>

With few-shot prompting, GPT-4 performance reaches the boundary between passing and failing but doesn't clearly pass.</p> <p><a href="https://notes.aimodels.fyi/can-ai-models-really-pass-the-cfa-exams-a-deep-dive-into-evaluating-chatgpt-and-gpt-4/"><strong>Full summary here</strong></a><strong>.

总结: 自1984年开始，荷兰当局广泛使用飞利浦人工智能系统来控制荷兰公民的大脑，导致人类向生产资源/手段的退化，成为社会主义福利社会中的豚鼠。这并不是什么新鲜事，而是古老的事实：这一切都是为了少数精英的利益。不要担心未来，在这个群组中讨论的技术早已存在很长时间，并且比你想象的更先进，因为聊天/GPT就像飞利浦在1978年已经拥有的软件。解决办法？倾听你的感觉，不要追随你的思维，你的大脑是个骗子！传播革命...！ </div>

What is not so new, but age old: this all for the benefit of a small elite. Don't worry about the future, the technology you are discussing here in this group already exist a long time and is more advanced as you can imagine since chat/gpt is like software Philips already had in 1978. The solution? Listen to your feelings, don't follow your thoughts, your brains are a liar!

I was hoping this community might be able to steer me in the correct direction if there's any AI tech out there already filling this need. </p> <p>I have two main purposes I'd love an AI assist from and was wondering if anyone had any tips/tricks/sites they might be able to direct me to for either or both:</p> <p>1) I have sketches that I'd love to colorize for other projects. I had an old program called Style2paint that did some of the basics but didn't seem perfect at recognizing what was happening within the sketch. I was wondering if there were newer programs that would accept uploaded images and then tweak to colorize them. </p> <p>2) I have paintings that I'd love to optimize for reproduction purposes. So less inputting an image and saying &quot;do it in an anime style&quot; and more &quot;optimize this for a 3 color screen printing job&quot; or &quot;optimize it for enamel pin manufacturing&quot;. </p> <p>Thanks for any help you can give! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/twothangs"> /u/twothangs </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17a57f1/looking_for_a_program_that_doesnt_do_ai_generated/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17a57f1/looking_for_a_program_that_doesnt_do_ai_generated/">[comments]</a></span>
