            <title>i love you all. 

today was a weird experience in many ways. but one unexpected one is that it has been sorta like reading your own eulogy while youâ€™re still alive. the outpouring of love is awesome.

one takeaway: go tell your friends how great you think they are.</title>

            <title>RT by @sama: Sam and I are shocked and saddened by what the board did today.

Let us first say thank you to all the incredible people who we have worked with at OpenAI, our customers, our investors, and all of those who have been reaching out.

We too are still trying to figure out exactly what happened. Here is what we know:

- Last night, Sam got a text from Ilya asking to talk at noon Friday. Sam joined a Google Meet and the whole board, except Greg, was there. Ilya told Sam he was being fired and that the news was going out very soon.

- At 12:19pm, Greg got a text from Ilya asking for a quick call. At 12:23pm, Ilya sent a Google Meet link. Greg was told that he was being removed from the board (but was vital to the company and would retain his role) and that Sam had been fired. Around the same time, OpenAI published a blog post.

- As far as we know, the management team was made aware of this shortly after, other than Mira who found out the night prior.

The outpouring of support has been really nice; thank you, but please donâ€™t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine. Greater things coming soon.</title>

            <title>R to @sama: (there is nuance in saying "regulate us, but not smaller competitors" that somehow ends up getting lost and we just get bashed, but i think it's important enough to be worth it.)</title>

            <title>there are some great parts about the AI EO, but as the govt implements it, it will be important not to slow down innovation by smaller companies/research teams.

i am pro-regulation on frontier systems, which is what openai has been calling for, and against regulatory capture.</title>
