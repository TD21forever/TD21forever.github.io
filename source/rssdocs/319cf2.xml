            <title>the fight for the future is a struggle between technological-driven growth and managed decline.

the growth path has inherent risks and challenges along with its fantastic upside, and the decline path has guaranteed long-term disaster.

stasis is a myth.</title>

            <title>muslim and arab (especially palestinian) colleagues in the tech community i've spoken with feel uncomfortable speaking about their recent experiences, often out of fear of retaliation and damaged career prospects.

our industry should be united in our support of these colleagues; it is an atrocious time. i continue to hope for a real and lasting peace, and that in the meantime we can treat each other with empathy.</title>

            <title>‘when the capitalists have run out of ideas, the interest rates will go to zero’ seemed like a very interesting observation to me over most of the last decade.

            <title>R to @sama: i am slowly making peace with being a public figure, which can be painful. i assume it will get more intense as our systems become much powerful and that's ok.

on the positive side, i have learned a lot this year.</title>

            <title>R to @sama: we have renewed focus on our mission to build safe AI that empowers people; we'll have remarkable progress to share in 2024.

i've never felt better about our research/product plans, and i look forward to us focusing more on what governance for this technology might look like.</title>

            <title>it’s been a crazy year.

i’m grateful that we put a tool out in the world that people really love and get so much benefit from.

more than that, i am glad that 2023 was the year the world started taking AI seriously.</title>
