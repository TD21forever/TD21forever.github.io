                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m a little worried about how this is gonna work out in the future. The pace at which openAI has been progressing is scary, many startups built over years might become obsolete in next few months with new chatgpt features. Also, most of the people I meet or know are mediocre at work, I can see chatgpt replacing their work easily. I was sceptical about it a year back that it’ll all happen so fast, but looking at the speed they’re working at right now. I’m scared af about the future. Off course you can now build things more easily and cheaper but what are people gonna work on? Normal mediocre repetitive work jobs ( work most of the people do ) will be replaced be it now or in 2-3 years top. There’s gonna be an unemployment issue on the scale we’ve not seen before, and there’ll be lesser jobs available. Specifically I’m more worried about the people graduating in next 2-3 years or students studying something for years, paying a heavy fees. But will their studies be relevant? Will they get jobs? Top 10% of the people might be hard to replace take 50% for a change but what about others? And this number is going to be too high in developing countries.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Humble_Moment1520"> /u/Humble_Moment1520 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/17pp747/openai_devday_was_scary_what_are_people_gonna/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/17pp747/openai_devday_was_scary_what_are_people_gonna/">[comments]</a></span>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>TLDR: I ignored the warnings from all the smart people here who told me that my app was a bad idea, so I had to learn that lesson the hard way.</p> <p>My idea was to create a platform for ChatGPT characters. My insight was that with a long initial prompt (5k+ words), you can generate quite compelling personalities that respond very differently than the regular ChatGPT. Additionally, you could feed it more knowledge and share the character with your friends or customers.</p> <p>I listened to almost every interview given by Sam Altman, just to keep well-informed about the future changes they might implement. His talk about enabling startups to build and flourish on top of the OpenAI API convinced me. Even guys from Y Combinator, like Michael and Dalton, reassured me that OpenAI's first, second, and third top priorities were to build AGI, and they would leave ample space for startups to develop ChatGPT-based apps. The YC guys can't be wrong, investing millions in wrapper startups, right? So, I believed, like many other developers, that OpenAI would focus on their model and API, leaving the customer-facing front end as basic as it was a year ago.</p> <p>I expected some friendly competition, like FlowGPT, which was fine and constructive. Back in June, I had several features that OpenAI didn't, such as voice communication. Slowly but surely, OpenAI incorporated all the features that my app had. They delivered the final deadly blow yesterday - a platform with GPTs.</p> <p>So, it's over for my project. Most users here were right; you can't really build a sustainable business on just a wrapper app. I thought I had some small moats and enough time, but at the end of the day, I was wrong. Now I understand the meaning of &quot;platform risk&quot;. Scrolling through Reddit and X, I see that I'm not alone.</p> <p>If your wrapper serves a really important need that ChatGPT users have, OpenAI will eventually address that need themselves. It's not out of malice; OpenAI simply wants to serve its users best, and if your startup is in the way, they will steamroll right over you.<br /> This happens even to YC-backed companies, so there's no hidden agenda, just a cold, harsh business environment. Nothing personal.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Exligent"> /u/Exligent </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/17ptif4/post_mortem_for_glome_social_a_wrapper/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/17ptif4/post_mortem_for_glome_social_a_wrapper/">[comments]</a></span>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I played around the API preview and what I found is the following:</p> <p>The 128k context length cannot keep a code script with 100 lines in its memory (1k-2k tokens or something very short either way compared to the context length of 128k).</p> <p>I pasted the script to the chat and asked for an improvement. I especially instructed it to give the full code back to me with the improvements. So yeah it did not do that, it gave me the script and needlessly gave few of the functions (not that long so few lines of code) as &quot;here goes the function in your previous code&quot;. Well I tortured the machine with custom instructions and made it very clear that it should always return me the full code with improvements and leave nothing out.</p> <p>It does not obey these instructions and still does not complete some of the code it gives back. It turns out the GPT-4 turbo claims that my original code did not have those functions spelled out, even though they were. This means that the 128k context length is some sort of compression, which means that any context you give it, it will just be compressed. It may or may not aknowledge some important part that is crucial for your task, depending whether it gets lost in the compression or not. I replicated this whole thing so many times that I just gave up and concluded that the 128k context length is mostly a marketing gimmick or there is some serious problems arising from demand that break the system. </p> <p>Well I do not need to spell out what this means for the accuracy or quality of the work it is doing. Sure I can compress a book and get a nice summary, but if that is not what I want I am out of luck. If I truly want it to understand my context I need to go back to old models, oh wait, those are now downgraded or at least display 2k max context length (compared to previous 8k for example). </p> <p>I think asking for 128k context length with the same quality as 8k for example, while it is faster and cheaper, is kinda dumb. But I cannot help to think that for coding and many real world tasks this is borderline unusable (at least for me and my use cases). </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Anzerp"> /u/Anzerp </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/17prwlg/gpt4_turbo_is_unusable_for_coding_and_various/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/17prwlg/gpt4_turbo_is_unusable_for_coding_and_various/">[comments]</a></span>

GPTs are a new way for anyone to create a tailored version of ChatGPT to be more helpful in their daily life, at specific tasks, at work, or at home—and then share that creation with others. For example, GPTs can help you learn the rules to any board game, help teach your kids math, or design stickers.</p> <p>Anyone can easily build their own GPT—no coding is required. You can make them for yourself, just for your company’s internal use, or for everyone. Creating one is as easy as starting a conversation, giving it instructions and extra knowledge, and picking what it can do, like searching the web, making images or analyzing data.</p> <p>Example GPTs are available today for ChatGPT Plus and Enterprise users to try out including Canva and Zapier AI Actions. We plan to offer GPTs to more users soon.</p> <p><a href="https://openai.com/blog/introducing-gpts">https://openai.com/blog/introducing-gpts</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ThoughtsFromAi"> /u/ThoughtsFromAi </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://i.redd.it/d18rjdh51syb1.jpg">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/17paf1q/gpts_are_here/">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>

Then the other night I started reading a book about Arthur Shopenhauer which contains lots of information I'm unfamiliar with. </p> <p>I realized that instead of typing a question I could just speak it so I turned on voice chat and spoke my question. After it answered I realized, the voice chat stays on in listening mode for a long time. So basically I had chatgpt silently sitting by while I read my book. When a passage was particularly interesting I would read it out loud and quickly ask a question. and it would answer. </p> <p>We began talking conversationally about what I was reading in real time! It made the reading experience absolutely mind-blowing - such conversations are a great way to retain what you've read and make the subject matter more interesting. I would encourage any avid readers to try this. I mostly read non-fiction so I can't say how well it would interpret meaning in fictional content.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RupFox"> /u/RupFox </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/17p968u/leaving_chatgpt_voice_on_while_reading_a_book_is/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/17p968u/leaving_chatgpt_voice_on_while_reading_a_book_is/">[comments]</a></span>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I'm hearing a lot about how gpt-4 has been awful recently and the current narrative is that it's because they've switched to <code>gpt-4-turbo</code>. I think it's worth checking out how all three perform with the same prompt, which we're lucky enough to be able to do using the API.</p> <p>For context, we use ChatGPT to analyse the stock market. We also use the same prompt for each model, with a temperature of 0.</p> <h1>gpt-4</h1> <p>Time taken: 25.146 seconds</p> <blockquote> <p>Senti Biosciences (SNTI) is in a strategic collaboration with Celest Therapeutics, potentially expanding its reach in China. This, coupled with promising preclinical data presentations, suggests a positive outlook. However, the stock's technical indicators show a bearish trend with SMAs and EMAs below the current price of $0.85 and RSI values indicating oversold conditions. Given the broader market uncertainty reflected in SPY and QQQ overviews, caution is advised. For today's session, consider a long position if the price breaks above the recent high of $1.04 with an entry price at $1.05 (confidence: 90%). Set the first target at $1.20 (confidence: 80%) and the second at $1.35 (confidence: 70%). Place a stop loss at $0.95.</p> </blockquote> <h1>gpt-3.5-turbo</h1> <p>Time taken: 15.346 seconds</p> <blockquote> <p>SNTI, Senti Biosciences, has recently announced a strategic collaboration with Celest Therapeutics for the clinical development of SENTI-301A in China. This partnership could open up new opportunities for SNTI in the Chinese market. Additionally, SNTI has presented new preclinical data with BlueRock Therapeutics at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer Annual Meeting, showcasing their progress and potential. These positive developments indicate momentum for SNTI, which may impact its stock price positively. Considering the broader market sentiment, SPY faces uncertainty due to the Israel-Hamas conflict and discussions of potential humanitarian ceasefires. The rare triple gap ups in the S&amp;P 500 ETF historically suggest weakness, urging caution for investors. Mixed market performance, rising Treasury yields, Warren Buffett's cash holdings, and a short squeeze in Treasuries contribute to an environment of uncertainty and potential volatility for SPY. For QQQ, the news highlights geopolitical tensions, market challenges, and Warren Buffett's increased cash holdings. The stock has been trading within a range with some volatility over the past 30 days. Moving averages and EMAs suggest a slightly bearish trend, while the RSI indicates an overbought condition. The negative MACD values further support a bearish signal. Overall, the outlook for QQQ today appears mixed, with potential uncertainties due to geopolitical tensions and rising Treasury yields. Based on the provided information, the analysis for SNTI indicates positive momentum, while SPY and QQQ face uncertainties and potential volatility.</p> </blockquote> <h1>gpt-4-turbo</h1> <p>Time taken: 11.714 seconds</p> <blockquote> <p>SNTI's recent strategic collaboration in China and positive R&amp;D presentations suggest an uptick in investor sentiment, potentially driving today's price action. The stock's technicals show a bearish trend with the 20-day EMA above the current price, but the latest candlestick surge to $0.85 on high volume indicates strong buying interest. The broader market presents a mixed outlook with SPY and QQQ analyses pointing to uncertainty and volatility, which could influence SNTI's performance. Entry Price: $0.86 (Confidence: 85%) First Target: $0.94 (Confidence: 90%) Second Target: $1.00 (Confidence: 90%) Stop Loss: $0.82 (Confidence: 90%)</p> </blockquote> <h1>Conclusion</h1> <p>I'm surprised that <code>gpt-4-turbo</code> is faster than <code>3.5-turbo</code>, I was expecting it to be the half way point between the other models.</p> <p>Performance-wise, <code>3.5-turbo</code> is easily the worst. It isn't respecting formatting (far too long) nor is it respecting content (no price estimates). However, I do think that <code>gpt-4</code> is quite a bit better than <code>gpt-4-turbo</code> given the above. <code>gpt-4-turbo</code> is mentioning &quot;strategic collaboration and positive R&amp;D&quot; but <code>gpt-4</code> is going into a bit more detail. Though I do believe this limitation can be overcome with some prompt updates.</p> <p>The price targets do represent a pretty large divergence though. One is expecting the stock to reach $1, while the other isn't interested until it hits $1.05. It'll take more testing but my initial belief is that <code>gpt-4</code> is (correctly) looking at extrapolating the price when the market opens, whereas <code>gpt-4-turbo</code> is looking at price action right now.</p> <p>Overall, I'm not currently convinced that <code>gpt-4-turbo</code> is a big step back. It's different, yes. It's worse, sure. But not massively to my eye.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ComfyRug"> /u/ComfyRug </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/17pq46a/quick_and_dirty_comparison_between_gpt4/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/17pq46a/quick_and_dirty_comparison_between_gpt4/">[comments]</a></span>
