                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>TLDR: I ignored the warnings from all the smart people here who told me that my app was a bad idea, so I had to learn that lesson the hard way.</p> <p>My idea was to create <a href="https://glome.social">a platform for ChatGPT characters</a>. My insight was that with a long initial prompt (5k+ words), you can generate quite compelling personalities that respond very differently than the regular ChatGPT. Additionally, you could feed it more knowledge and share the character with your friends or customers.</p> <p>I listened to almost every interview given by Sam Altman, just to keep well-informed about the future changes they might implement. His talk about enabling startups to build and flourish on top of the OpenAI API convinced me. Even guys from Y Combinator, like Michael and Dalton, reassured me that OpenAI's first, second, and third top priorities were to build AGI, and they would leave ample space for startups to develop ChatGPT-based apps. The YC guys can't be wrong, investing millions in wrapper startups, right? So, I believed, like many other developers, that OpenAI would focus on their model and API, leaving the customer-facing front end as basic as it was a year ago.</p> <p>I expected some friendly competition, like FlowGPT, which was fine and constructive. Back in June, I had several features that OpenAI didn't, such as voice communication. Slowly but surely, OpenAI incorporated all the features that my app had. They delivered the final deadly blow yesterday - a platform with GPTs.</p> <p>So, it's over for my project. Most users here were right; you can't really build a sustainable business on just a wrapper app. I thought I had some small moats and enough time, but at the end of the day, I was wrong. Now I understand the meaning of &quot;platform risk&quot;. Scrolling through Reddit and X, I see that I'm not alone.</p> <p>If your wrapper serves a really important need that ChatGPT users have, OpenAI will eventually address that need themselves. It's not out of malice; OpenAI simply wants to serve its users best, and if your startup is in the way, they will steamroll right over you.This happens even to YC-backed companies, so there's no hidden agenda, just a cold, harsh business environment. Nothing personal.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Exligent"> /u/Exligent </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/17ptif4/post_mortem_for_glome_social_a_wrapper/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/17ptif4/post_mortem_for_glome_social_a_wrapper/">[comments]</a></span>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m a little worried about how this is gonna work out in the future. The pace at which openAI has been progressing is scary, many startups built over years might become obsolete in next few months with new chatgpt features. Also, most of the people I meet or know are mediocre at work, I can see chatgpt replacing their work easily. I was sceptical about it a year back that it’ll all happen so fast, but looking at the speed they’re working at right now. I’m scared af about the future. Off course you can now build things more easily and cheaper but what are people gonna work on? Normal mediocre repetitive work jobs ( work most of the people do ) will be replaced be it now or in 2-3 years top. There’s gonna be an unemployment issue on the scale we’ve not seen before, and there’ll be lesser jobs available. Specifically I’m more worried about the people graduating in next 2-3 years or students studying something for years, paying a heavy fees. But will their studies be relevant? Will they get jobs? Top 10% of the people might be hard to replace take 50% for a change but what about others? And this number is going to be too high in developing countries.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Humble_Moment1520"> /u/Humble_Moment1520 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/17pp747/openai_devday_was_scary_what_are_people_gonna/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/17pp747/openai_devday_was_scary_what_are_people_gonna/">[comments]</a></span>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I played around the API preview and what I found is the following:</p> <p>The 128k context length cannot keep a code script with 100 lines in its memory (1k-2k tokens or something very short either way compared to the context length of 128k).</p> <p>I pasted the script to the chat and asked for an improvement. I especially instructed it to give the full code back to me with the improvements. So yeah it did not do that, it gave me the script and needlessly gave few of the functions (not that long so few lines of code) as &quot;here goes the function in your previous code&quot;. Well I tortured the machine with custom instructions and made it very clear that it should always return me the full code with improvements and leave nothing out.</p> <p>It does not obey these instructions and still does not complete some of the code it gives back. It turns out the GPT-4 turbo claims that my original code did not have those functions spelled out, even though they were. This means that the 128k context length is some sort of compression, which means that any context you give it, it will just be compressed. It may or may not aknowledge some important part that is crucial for your task, depending whether it gets lost in the compression or not. I replicated this whole thing so many times that I just gave up and concluded that the 128k context length is mostly a marketing gimmick or there is some serious problems arising from demand that break the system.</p> <p>Well I do not need to spell out what this means for the accuracy or quality of the work it is doing. Sure I can compress a book and get a nice summary, but if that is not what I want I am out of luck. If I truly want it to understand my context I need to go back to old models, oh wait, those are now downgraded or at least display 2k max context length (compared to previous 8k for example).</p> <p>I think asking for 128k context length with the same quality as 8k for example, while it is faster and cheaper, is kinda dumb. But I cannot help to think that for coding and many real world tasks this is borderline unusable (at least for me and my use cases).</p> <p>EDIT: </p> <p>I will just clarify few things here. So my input + output was way under 4k (limit of output currently). GPT 3.5 and GPT 4 with shorter context could handle the code without compression, so this is problem that affects only GPT-4 Turbo (preview). This limitation is something that cannot be circumvented with &quot;prompt engineering&quot;.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Anzerp"> /u/Anzerp </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/17prwlg/gpt4_turbo_is_unusable_for_coding_and_various/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/17prwlg/gpt4_turbo_is_unusable_for_coding_and_various/">[comments]</a></span>

I'll point it out, it acknowledges how its wrong but keeps insisting on sticking in the wrong code. Spending more time trying to explain how it's wrong &amp; how it should be done then actually getting the right output.</p> <p>Update: after I posted this I went back and it got even more bizarre. It kept trying to put executions into their own functions. Explained we should keep the task in one function and it would put functions inside of functions. For example I needed a word in brackets if it wasn't already formatted that way and instead of doing a simple one line if statement like it always has it proceeded to make it it's own function. I gave up when it couldn't give me the correct call to a Google Sheet using getSheetById when it had no issues doing this yesterday. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MusicWasMy1stLuv"> /u/MusicWasMy1stLuv </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/17pxgwb/chatgpt_this_morning_more_broke_than_ever/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/17pxgwb/chatgpt_this_morning_more_broke_than_ever/">[comments]</a></span>
