                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>TLDR: I ignored the warnings from all the smart people here who told me that my app was a bad idea, so I had to learn that lesson the hard way.</p> <p>My idea was to create <a href="https://glome.social">a platform for ChatGPT characters</a>. My insight was that with a long initial prompt (5k+ words), you can generate quite compelling personalities that respond very differently than the regular ChatGPT. Additionally, you could feed it more knowledge and share the character with your friends or customers.</p> <p>I listened to almost every interview given by Sam Altman, just to keep well-informed about the future changes they might implement. His talk about enabling startups to build and flourish on top of the OpenAI API convinced me. Even guys from Y Combinator, like Michael and Dalton, reassured me that OpenAI's first, second, and third top priorities were to build AGI, and they would leave ample space for startups to develop ChatGPT-based apps. The YC guys can't be wrong, investing millions in wrapper startups, right? So, I believed, like many other developers, that OpenAI would focus on their model and API, leaving the customer-facing front end as basic as it was a year ago.</p> <p>I expected some friendly competition, like FlowGPT, which was fine and constructive. Back in June, I had several features that OpenAI didn't, such as voice communication. Slowly but surely, OpenAI incorporated all the features that my app had. They delivered the final deadly blow yesterday - a platform with GPTs.</p> <p>So, it's over for my project. Most users here were right; you can't really build a sustainable business on just a wrapper app. I thought I had some small moats and enough time, but at the end of the day, I was wrong. Now I understand the meaning of &quot;platform risk&quot;. Scrolling through Reddit and X, I see that I'm not alone.</p> <p>If your wrapper serves a really important need that ChatGPT users have, OpenAI will eventually address that need themselves. It's not out of malice; OpenAI simply wants to serve its users best, and if your startup is in the way, they will steamroll right over you.This happens even to YC-backed companies, so there's no hidden agenda, just a cold, harsh business environment. Nothing personal.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Exligent"> /u/Exligent </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/17ptif4/post_mortem_for_glome_social_a_wrapper/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/17ptif4/post_mortem_for_glome_social_a_wrapper/">[comments]</a></span>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m a little worried about how this is gonna work out in the future. The pace at which openAI has been progressing is scary, many startups built over years might become obsolete in next few months with new chatgpt features. Also, most of the people I meet or know are mediocre at work, I can see chatgpt replacing their work easily. I was sceptical about it a year back that it’ll all happen so fast, but looking at the speed they’re working at right now. I’m scared af about the future. Off course you can now build things more easily and cheaper but what are people gonna work on? Normal mediocre repetitive work jobs ( work most of the people do ) will be replaced be it now or in 2-3 years top. There’s gonna be an unemployment issue on the scale we’ve not seen before, and there’ll be lesser jobs available. Specifically I’m more worried about the people graduating in next 2-3 years or students studying something for years, paying a heavy fees. But will their studies be relevant? Will they get jobs? Top 10% of the people might be hard to replace take 50% for a change but what about others? And this number is going to be too high in developing countries.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Humble_Moment1520"> /u/Humble_Moment1520 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/17pp747/openai_devday_was_scary_what_are_people_gonna/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/17pp747/openai_devday_was_scary_what_are_people_gonna/">[comments]</a></span>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I played around the API preview and what I found is the following:</p> <p>The 128k context length cannot keep a code script with 100 lines in its memory (1k-2k tokens or something very short either way compared to the context length of 128k).</p> <p>I pasted the script to the chat and asked for an improvement. I especially instructed it to give the full code back to me with the improvements. So yeah it did not do that, it gave me the script and needlessly gave few of the functions (not that long so few lines of code) as &quot;here goes the function in your previous code&quot;. Well I tortured the machine with custom instructions and made it very clear that it should always return me the full code with improvements and leave nothing out.</p> <p>It does not obey these instructions and still does not complete some of the code it gives back. It turns out the GPT-4 turbo claims that my original code did not have those functions spelled out, even though they were. This means that the 128k context length is some sort of compression, which means that any context you give it, it will just be compressed. It may or may not aknowledge some important part that is crucial for your task, depending whether it gets lost in the compression or not. I replicated this whole thing so many times that I just gave up and concluded that the 128k context length is mostly a marketing gimmick or there is some serious problems arising from demand that break the system.</p> <p>Well I do not need to spell out what this means for the accuracy or quality of the work it is doing. Sure I can compress a book and get a nice summary, but if that is not what I want I am out of luck. If I truly want it to understand my context I need to go back to old models, oh wait, those are now downgraded or at least display 2k max context length (compared to previous 8k for example).</p> <p>I think asking for 128k context length with the same quality as 8k for example, while it is faster and cheaper, is kinda dumb. But I cannot help to think that for coding and many real world tasks this is borderline unusable (at least for me and my use cases).</p> <p>EDIT: </p> <p>I will just clarify few things here. So my input + output was way under 4k (limit of output currently). GPT 3.5 and GPT 4 with shorter context could handle the code without compression, so this is problem that affects only GPT-4 Turbo (preview). This limitation is something that cannot be circumvented with &quot;prompt engineering&quot;.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Anzerp"> /u/Anzerp </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/17prwlg/gpt4_turbo_is_unusable_for_coding_and_various/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/17prwlg/gpt4_turbo_is_unusable_for_coding_and_various/">[comments]</a></span>

I'll point it out, it acknowledges how its wrong but keeps insisting on sticking in the wrong code. Spending more time trying to explain how it's wrong &amp; how it should be done then actually getting the right output.</p> <p>Update: after I posted this I went back and it got even more bizarre. It kept trying to put executions into their own functions. Explained we should keep the task in one function and it would put functions inside of functions. For example I needed a word in brackets if it wasn't already formatted that way and instead of doing a simple one line if statement like it always has it proceeded to make it it's own function. I gave up when it couldn't give me the correct call to a Google Sheet using getSheetById when it had no issues doing this yesterday. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MusicWasMy1stLuv"> /u/MusicWasMy1stLuv </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/17pxgwb/chatgpt_this_morning_more_broke_than_ever/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/17pxgwb/chatgpt_this_morning_more_broke_than_ever/">[comments]</a></span>

Today we’re launching a preview of the next generation of this model, <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4-and-gpt-4-turbo">GPT-4 Turbo</a>. </p> <p>GPT-4 Turbo is more capable and has knowledge of world events up to April 2023. It has a 128k context window so it can fit the equivalent of more than 300 pages of text in a single prompt. We also optimized its performance so we are able to offer GPT-4 Turbo at a <a href="https://openai.com/pricing#gpt-4-turbo">3x cheaper</a> price for input tokens and a 2x cheaper price for output tokens compared to GPT-4.</p> <p>GPT-4 Turbo is available for all paying developers to try by passing gpt-4-1106-preview<br /> in the API and we plan to release the stable production-ready model in the coming weeks.</p> <p>*****************************************</p> <p>With a much more recent knowledge cutoff and drastically improved context window shouldn't GPT-4 Turbo be absolutely smoking the other models? Do we have any details on how OpenAI &quot;<em>optimized its performance so we are able to offer GPT-4 Turbo at a</em> <a href="https://openai.com/pricing#gpt-4-turbo"><em>3x cheaper</em></a> <em>price?</em>&quot;</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/the_bollo"> /u/the_bollo </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/17q16kt/why_are_people_upset_about_gpt4_turbo_is_the/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/17q16kt/why_are_people_upset_about_gpt4_turbo_is_the/">[comments]</a></span>

GPTs are a new way for anyone to create a tailored version of ChatGPT to be more helpful in their daily life, at specific tasks, at work, or at home—and then share that creation with others. For example, GPTs can help you learn the rules to any board game, help teach your kids math, or design stickers.</p> <p>Anyone can easily build their own GPT—no coding is required. You can make them for yourself, just for your company’s internal use, or for everyone. Creating one is as easy as starting a conversation, giving it instructions and extra knowledge, and picking what it can do, like searching the web, making images or analyzing data.</p> <p>Example GPTs are available today for ChatGPT Plus and Enterprise users to try out including Canva and Zapier AI Actions.

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><h1>System prompt changes</h1> <p>There have been quite a few changes to the former &quot;All Tools&quot; system prompt since the &quot;Dev Days&quot; launch of the new ChatGPT interface. (You can <a href="https://github.com/spdustin/ChatGPT-AutoExpert/blob/main/_system-prompts/all_tools.md">see the new system prompt here</a>.)</p> <h2>Image uploads</h2> <p>Quite a big change here. Entire sections of the instructions were removed. - The first big thing: The &quot;Taxonomy&quot; and &quot;Definitions for Sensitive Inferences&quot; sections have been removed entirely, as have the &quot;Instructions&quot; and &quot;Rubrics&quot; used to determine how to respond to queries about an uploaded image. - The previous &quot;Sensitive Inferences&quot; (and related) instructions are now distilled to a single sentence: - Not allowed: [snip] Making inappropriate statements about people. - But it is allowed to answer &quot;appropriate questions&quot; and make &quot;appropriate statements&quot; about people. - It will not identify any TV/Movie characters. - (The conflicting instructions allowing the indentification of animated characters but disallowing the identification of &quot;TV/Movie characters&quot; will be updated at some point, if I had to guess.) - ChatGPT will no longer outright refuse to say things about images with people in them any more (except for the &quot;inappropriate&quot; and &quot;identification&quot; clauses above). - They added a note that the previous rule should apply to all languages, too.</p> <h2>DALL•E</h2> <p>The DALL•E portion of the &quot;ChatGPT 4&quot; system prompt has changed significantly since &quot;pre-Dev Days&quot; version, also. - Before, it said &quot;whenever a description of an image is given, use dalle to create it&quot; at the beginning of the defintion for this tool. Now, it says &quot;Whenever a description of an image is given, create a prompt that dalle can use to generate the image&quot; (both more and less precise than before) - The instructions for generating images are much less prescriptive, too: - <strong>Before</strong>: &gt; The single detailed caption must intricately describe every part of the image in concrete, objective detail. THINK about what the end goal of the description is, and extrapolate that to what would make satisfying images. All descriptions sent to dalle should be a paragraph of text that is extremely descriptive and detailed. Each should be more than 3 sentences long. - <strong>After</strong>: &gt; The generated prompt sent to dalle should be very detailed, and around 100 words long. - The instruction dictating the diversity of people in a generated image has been expanded.
