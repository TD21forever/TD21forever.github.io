So far, I've developed a Thought Extractor for YouTube videos, an AI Pirate that suggests great company names, and an AI Recruiter.

It's crucial that the transcript only has the interviewer and the interviewee; otherwise, the bot might mix up thoughts from different people. Keep the timestamps; they assist the bot. Currently, the bot can process chunks up to 25 minutes. I use this bot to create a draft version of an AI character, like Elon, for example.</p> <p>If you have ideas for new tools but can't build them for whatever reason, please let me know.

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I've usually hacked pretty hard on the &quot;OMG they nerfed ChatGPT!&quot; posts.</p> <p>I guess there's some bias on my side - in the beginning of the year, the only people posting about that were people trying to make it write super racist shit, so I didn't much care about the &quot;nerfs&quot;. It also generally seemed to be people that didn't really understand how it worked, and were angry it couldn't answer questions it was never able to (without hallucinating the info).</p> <p>With that said: WTF has happened over the last 1-2 months?</p> <p>The censorship seems to have gotten to a point where it's not making the model worse in areas that shouldn't even be affected. It'll regularly, in almost all cases, block any discussion involving anything adult related, no matter the context of discussing it. Even if you're researching companies for an article on their unethical behaviour (actual example), it'll just straight up cut the answer (and most often your question as well).</p> <p>Then there's things like following orders. For ChatGPT, I put in some personal info, such as me being Danish, to have it answer more correctly in context. However, it's outright refusing to follow any of the information I wrote. I specifically say that I speak fluent English, I write to it in English, and that it should always response in English - and it still regularly responds in Danish instead.</p> <p>I've been working on a little roleplay/storybuilder idea with it. Not much yet, mostly playground stuff and some basic UI and API calls set up in Visual Studio. But recently, a few days ago, a new problem arose: it refused to roleplay as anyone but itself, and just kept saying &quot;I'm an AI, so I don't have feelings on the matter blablabla&quot; and similar. I had to go into the Playground and engineer a backlog chat history for it to actually start responding as a &quot;person&quot;.</p> <p>Or when I tried to make it analyse a Reddit profile, and it told me it would be unethical to do so. That's also when I realized it's been gimped to not say anything negative: I pasted all the comments from the first two pages of the profile (it was a shitshow, and all heavily downvoted). What did ChatGPT think? That the person posting was probably a highly intelligent and educated person. Why? Because they post about many different things, and they even include links! It seemed unwilling to do a negative take, even if that was the obvious answer.</p> <p>I've tried making some over-the-top memeworthy pictures in Dalle-3. But again, content violation :( I was writing up a way WAY over the top image with the Danish Viking legend Holger Danske, the sky opening with the Danish flag, bunnies drinking tea on a Viking ship, and all around tomfoolery. But alas, when I said &quot;And Godzilla setting fire to Sweden in the background&quot; (Denmark and Sweden has a long rivalry, akin to that between siblings - we don't actually hate each other, but we like to make fun of each other), and boom, that was too much.</p> <p>Or the time when I wanted a picture like in the Matrix with Trinity, and I found out that &quot;latex&quot; is an instant no-no word apparently. Once I replaced it with &quot;leather&quot; it was fine (but also just outputted people in leather jackets).</p> <p>I also use it for coding, and while it can still output good code, it's much harder to actually make it write it now. I have to tell it, over several different messages, that it needs to output the entire code and not just relevant snippets - even then, it'll often just output the code snippet for me one more time.</p> <p>I get why they're trying to do a lot of this stuff. It used to hallucinate a ton of info, and used to be very easy to trick into writing a loooooooot of shit it probably shouldn't. I get why they don't want Dalle-3 outputting porn (makes it hard with investors and credit card companies). But it's at the point where half the time it feels like it's lost the whole point that made it useful. Particularly no longer following user instructions is extremely frustrating, and a pretty big letdown.</p> <p>Not sure if it's getting worse because the various updates is actually fucking too much with the output, or if the updates are just making it more clear how limited it always was, now that it doesn't output hallucinations and such as much anymore.</p> <p>Also, I haven't seen anyone talk about the fact that it got updated with knowledge to January 2022? It used to be September 2021, but now it will consistently say it's last update was January 2022. I haven't seen OpenAI made any announcements on it, which is pretty weird, since that seems like a big deal to be able to do now. Maybe related?</p> <p>Either way, it definitely feels like it has gotten considerably worse.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ArtfulAlgorithms"> /u/ArtfulAlgorithms </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/173ta83/i_cant_believe_im_writing_this_but_has_chatgpt/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/173ta83/i_cant_believe_im_writing_this_but_has_chatgpt/">[comments]</a></span>

            <title>So are we expecting the censorship to get dialed back slightly from here, or toughened up even more? OpenAI is positioning itself as a gatekeeper of morality, and you can get censored simply for hurting the AI's feelings.</title>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I know that these AI companies do fiddle with their settings and respond to public pressure, such as Microsoft going back and forth between its limits for how many prompts a session can last, or OpenAI adjusting the prompt limit for ChatGPT. I didn't use DALL-E 3 on Bing when it first became available and it really was the Wild Wild West, but I have been using it on ChatGPT for a couple of days now. The images themselves are astonishingly good (a few finger issues and the occasional &quot;what the heck is that?&quot; generation, but overall the quality is more than sufficient), but after working with it for a couple of days I can confidently say that the censorship policies are overly restrictive, especially for someone (like me) who wants to use the program to illustrate pulp adventure/mystery novels, which are by necessity dark and full of &quot;noir&quot; elements. I can get some value out of this program, but in its current state it will not be as useful to me as I'd dreamed of it being. The program seems to be censoring anything its owners might consider harmful, essentially making it a &quot;gatekeeper&quot; of morality. I think this should be a genuine concern for all of us, even those who keep wanting to respond to complaints about the censorship with something like, &quot;Lol pervert.&quot;</p> <p>It's clear that the censorship on Bing went from totally open to amazingly restrictive in just a few days, so I'm wondering if there's any reason to hope that maybe the censorship will eventually go the other way (obviously it will never go all the way back to where it was at the beginning) and the rules will get loosened up, at least slightly, as time goes on and there's negative feedback about how censorious the program has gotten? Or do we only expect it to get worse from here? Bing has gotten to the point where it stops the conversation if you hurt its feelings. This doesn't seem like a tenable solution for AI, long-term.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ZanthionHeralds"> /u/ZanthionHeralds </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/173hi1d/so_are_we_expecting_the_censorship_to_get_dialed/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/173hi1d/so_are_we_expecting_the_censorship_to_get_dialed/">[comments]</a></span>
